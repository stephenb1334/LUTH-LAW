    -   §83.49(3)(b): Tenant has 15 days to object in writing to the landlord's claim. 
    -   §83.49(3)(c): Failure to provide the required notice within 30 days forfeits the landlord's right to impose a claim, and the landlord must return the deposit immediately. 
-   Specific Violations by Landlord:

    -   Evidence: Copy of the notice in Appendix G-1. 
    -   Lack of Evidence: No documentation provided to support the deductions from the security deposit. 
    -   Withholding Entire Deposit: Retained the entire $4,500 without valid justification. 
-   Relevant Case Law:

    -   Williams v. Ridge, 548 So. 2d 410 (Fla. 3d DCA 1989): Emphasizes the necessity of detailed notices to comply with statutory requirements. 
-   Legal Analysis
    -   Non-Compliance with Statutory Requirements:
        -   The landlord's failure to provide a detailed, itemized notice violates §83.49(3)(a). 
        -   Under §83.49(3)(c), this non-compliance forfeits the landlord's right to impose a claim, and the deposit must be returned. 
    -   Bad Faith Withholding:
        -   Requirement for Additional Damages:
            -   Additional damages and attorney's fees may be awarded if the landlord acted in bad faith. 
            -   Bad faith must be demonstrated and is not presumed. 
        -   Evidence of Bad Faith:
            -   Landlord's professional status as an attorney suggests knowledge of statutory requirements. 
            -   Willful disregard for the law and failure to comply may constitute bad faith. 
            -   Reference: Communications in Appendix C-4 show landlord's awareness and intentional non-compliance. 
-   Potential Damages
    -   Return of Security Deposit: $4,500 
    -   Attorney's Fees and Court Costs: Recoverable if bad faith is proven under §83.49(3)(c). 

**B. Unlawful Retention and Conversion of Tenant's Personal Property**

-   Statutory Requirements:
    -   Notice Requirement: Landlord must provide written notice to the former tenant regarding the disposal of personal property left on the premises.

-   Relevant Statute:
    -   Florida Statute §715.109: Failure to comply with §715.104 may result in the landlord being liable for damages caused by the non-compliance. 
-   Legal Analysis of Conversion
    -   Definition of Conversion in Florida Law:
        -   Conversion is the unauthorized act of dominion or control over another's personal property inconsistent with their ownership rights. 
    -   Elements of Conversion:
        1.  Ownership: Tenant owns the personal property. 
            
            -   Evidence: Receipts and photographs in Appendix F. 
            
        2.  Unauthorized Control: Landlord exercised control over the property without consent. 
            
            -   Evidence: Use of property in advertisements (Appendix E). 
            
        3.  Deprivation: Tenant was deprived of possession and use of the property. 
            
            -   Evidence: Documented retrieval attempts ignored by landlord (Appendix C-3).
