VIA CERTIFIED MAIL RETURN RECEIPT REQUESTED

Luther J. Rollins, Jr. Amarlu Enterprises 231 Government Ave. S.W., #3097 Hickory, NC 28603

RE: FINAL DEMAND AND NOTICE OF IMPENDING LEGAL ACTION Property: 2649 Tifton St. S., Gulfport, FL 33711

Dear Mr. Rollins:

Your November 8, 2024 response to my tenant dispute letter demonstrates a staggering failure to grasp the severity of your position. Your paltry offer of $2,000 ($1,500 for security deposit and $500 for converted property) is not merely inadequate—it is an insult that further proves your continuing pattern of bad faith and willful misconduct. As an attorney, you should understand that your actions have exposed you to catastrophic liability far beyond mere compensatory damages.

Your letter's opening references to hurricane damage and hopes for "amicable" resolution ring hollow given your documented pattern of statutory violations, harassment, and professional misconduct. You claim to have "ample" evidence supporting your position, yet you continue to withhold it, even after I gave you a second chance to provide documentation. This tactical choice speaks volumes about the reality of your claims.

Let me be explicitly clear: This letter represents your final opportunity to avoid litigation that will expose the full scope of your illegal business operations, professional misconduct, and statutory violations. Your status as a licensed attorney makes each violation not merely a civil infraction but potential grounds for professional discipline.

I. ILLEGAL BUSINESS OPERATIONS AND VOID LEASE

Your most fatal error was orchestrating an elaborate scheme to collect rent through Amarlu Enterprises, an unregistered foreign entity. The evidence of this illegal operation is overwhelming:

1.  You provided pre-stamped, pre-addressed envelopes directing payments to Amarlu Enterprises
2.  You collected $45,000 in rent payments through this unauthorized entity
3.  You deliberately omitted any mention of Amarlu Enterprises from the lease
4.  You continue to operate this illegal enterprise in violation of Florida Statute §605.0902

As a licensed attorney, you cannot claim ignorance of Florida's foreign entity registration requirements. Your decision to funnel rental income through an unregistered entity was calculated and willful. This violation alone renders the entire lease void and illegal, requiring:

-   Return of all rent paid ($45,000)
-   Return of security deposit ($4,500)
-   Return of pet deposit ($500)
-   Compensation for converted property ($4,210.62)

Your collection of these funds through an unregistered entity may also constitute criminal violations that will be reported to appropriate authorities regardless of your response to this letter.

II. SECURITY DEPOSIT VIOLATIONS AND BAD FAITH

Your handling of the security deposit epitomizes your contempt for Florida law. Your "Notice of Intention to Impose Claim" was a masterclass in statutory violations:

-   ZERO itemization of alleged damages
-   NO photographs or documentation
-   VAGUE claims about "damage to walls" without specifying location or nature
-   INCORRECT zip code that delayed delivery
-   REFERENCE to a non-existent inventory list

You now claim to possess "ample photos, witnesses, and documentation" yet deliberately withhold them. This tactical choice exposes you to maximum statutory penalties under Florida Statute §83.49. Your status as an attorney transforms this from mere negligence into willful misconduct warranting treble damages.

III. GROSS NEGLIGENCE AND PREMISES LIABILITY

Your failure to address known security hazards after a violent break-in demonstrates shocking indifference to tenant safety:

-   REFUSED to repair broken gates despite acknowledging the security risk
-   RESTRICTED installation of security cameras by prohibiting proper mounting
-   IGNORED documented concerns about the intruder living nearby
-   FAILED to implement ANY security improvements despite the assault on premises

This negligence exacerbated my diagnosed PTSD and created ongoing psychological trauma. Courts routinely award substantial damages for such willful disregard of tenant safety, particularly when the landlord is a legal professional who fully understands premises liability.

IV. HARASSMENT AND COERCIVE CONDUCT

Your response to my formal dispute letter reveals a disturbing pattern of harassment:

-   THREE phone calls in 48 hours
-   MULTIPLE voicemails pressuring for verbal communication
-   TEXT messages misrepresenting legal requirements for "amicable" discussion
-   DELIBERATE disregard of my written communication directive

As an attorney, you knew or should have known that such pressure tactics constitute harassment under Florida law. Your attempts to leverage your legal expertise to intimidate me will be highlighted prominently in both the civil complaint and bar association reports.

V. CONVERSION OF PERSONAL PROPERTY

Your brazen conversion of my personal property for commercial gain is well-documented:

-   IGNORED multiple written requests to retrieve my belongings
-   FAILED to provide statutory notice under Florida Statute §715.104
-   CONTINUED using my Weber grill to market the property
-   BENEFITED financially from unauthorized use of my property

This ongoing conversion entitles me to both compensatory and punitive damages, particularly given your willful misconduct as an attorney.


VI. DEMANDS FOR COMPENSATION

Given your egregious violations of Florida law and professional ethics, I demand the following compensation:

A. Direct Financial Recovery

-   Full return of all rent paid: $45,000
-   Security deposit return: $4,500
-   Pet deposit return: $500
-   Value of converted property: $4,210.62 SUBTOTAL: $54,210.62

This figure represents only baseline compensation before consideration of:

-   Treble damages under Florida Statute §83.49
-   Punitive damages for willful misconduct
-   Emotional distress damages related to PTSD
-   Attorney's fees and costs
-   Statutory penalties for operating an unregistered business

B. Timeline for Compliance You have FIFTEEN (15) DAYS from receipt of this letter to:

1.  Remit payment of $54,210.62 via certified check or wire transfer
2.  Provide written confirmation of payment
3.  Return ALL converted personal property in original condition

VII. CONSEQUENCES OF NON-COMPLIANCE

Should you fail to meet these demands within 15 days, I will immediately:

A. Legal Action

-   File suit in Florida Circuit Court seeking maximum damages
-   Request emergency injunctive relief regarding converted property
-   Pursue punitive damages based on your status as an attorney
-   Seek treble damages for bad-faith security deposit retention

B. Professional/Regulatory Reports

1.  Bar Association Complaints

-   Florida Bar Association (unauthorized business practices)
-   North Carolina Bar Association (professional misconduct)
-   Missouri Bar Association (ethical violations)

2.  Regulatory Agency Reports

-   Florida Department of Business and Professional Regulation
-   Florida Department of Revenue (unregistered business operations)
-   North Carolina Department of Revenue (tax implications)
-   Internal Revenue Service (questionable business practices)

C. Public Record All filings will emphasize your status as an attorney engaging in:

-   Deliberate statutory violations
-   Harassment of tenants
-   Operation of illegal business enterprises
-   Conversion of tenant property
-   Bad faith security deposit retention

The resulting publicity and professional scrutiny could devastate your legal career. This is not a threat - it is a statement of fact and natural consequence of your actions.

VIII. FINAL NOTICE

Let me be unequivocally clear: This is your FINAL opportunity to resolve this matter before I initiate scorched-earth litigation that will expose every aspect of your business practices to judicial and professional scrutiny. Your status as an attorney transforms each violation from mere negligence into knowing misconduct warranting maximum penalties.

The $54,210.62 demanded here is a FRACTION of what a jury might award after hearing evidence of an attorney operating an illegal business enterprise while harassing tenants and converting their property. Your professional reputation and license to practice law hang in the balance.

Choose wisely.

Sincerely,

Stephen Boerner 424 North New Street Bethlehem, PA 18018
