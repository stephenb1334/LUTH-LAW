**I. OVERARCHING LEGAL VIOLATIONS AND MISREPRESENTATION**

Before addressing your specific claims, it is crucial to highlight the overarching legal violations that undermine the validity of your entire position:

**A. Unregistered Foreign Entity (Amarlu Enterprises):**

1.  **Non-Disclosure:** The lease agreement explicitly names only Luther Rollins and Mary O. Polk as landlords, acting in their individual capacities. However, all rent payments were directed to Amarlu Enterprises, a North Carolina-registered entity jointly owned by you. This entity was never disclosed in the lease, concealing its critical role in collecting rental income.
2.  **Violation of Florida Statute §605.0902:** Amarlu Enterprises is registered in North Carolina but does not appear in the Florida Division of Corporations’ database. Under Florida Statutes § 605.0902, any out-of-state business entity engaging in business activities, including collecting rental income from Florida property, must register as a foreign entity. Amarlu Enterprises’ failure to register in Florida constitutes a direct violation of Florida’s foreign entity registration requirements, compromising its legal standing and your compliance with state business laws.
3.  **Fraudulent Misrepresentation:** Instructing tenants to pay a non-disclosed, unregistered entity (Amarlu Enterprises) undermines tenants’ understanding of their contractual obligations and potentially violates Florida’s landlord-tenant transparency laws. Diverting rental income through an unregistered foreign entity raises concerns about possible tax avoidance or evasion.
4.  **Impact on Lease Enforceability:** The deliberate omission of Amarlu Enterprises from the lease agreement and the subsequent instruction to pay that entity could be construed as fraudulent. This setup potentially deceives tenants about the true nature of their rental arrangement and circumvents their legal and tax obligations in Florida. As a result, the entire lease agreement is legally questionable, if not outright void.

**B. Misrepresentation of Landlord Address:**

1.  **Lease Discrepancy:** The lease agreement lists the landlord’s address as the same address as the leased property (2649 Tifton St S, Gulfport, FL), which is not your actual address. This is a direct violation of Florida Statute §83.50(1)(b), which requires the landlord to disclose their correct address.
2.  **Intentional Obfuscation:** This misrepresentation was not a simple oversight but a deliberate attempt to obscure your true location and complicate communication. This is further evidenced by the use of a P.O. Box address for Amarlu Enterprises, which is not a valid business address under North Carolina law.
3.  **Impact on Tenant Rights:** This misrepresentation made it difficult for me to send written notices and requests, further demonstrating your bad faith.

**C. Ethical and Professional Misconduct:**

1.  **Misrepresentation as a Lawyer:** Your use of the email address “luther2law@gmail.com” implies legal expertise, despite not being licensed in Florida. This is a deliberate attempt to intimidate and mislead me, potentially violating Rule 4-8.4(c) (dishonesty or misrepresentation) and Rule 4-8.4(d) (prejudicial to justice) of the Florida Bar.
2.  **Abuse of Legal Knowledge:** As a licensed attorney in North Carolina and Missouri, your actions raise serious ethical concerns and potential bar violations. Your use of professional knowledge to structure lease and payment arrangements that circumvent Florida law is a serious breach of professional ethics.

**II. SECURITY DEPOSIT MISMANAGEMENT**

Your handling of the security deposit is a textbook example of how NOT to comply with Florida law. Your actions demonstrate a blatant disregard for tenant rights and a calculated attempt to unlawfully retain funds.

**A. Improper Notice of Claim:**

1.  **Lack of Itemization:** Your initial “Notice of Intention to Impose Claim on Security Deposit” failed to provide a specific itemization of damages, detailed reasons for deductions, and supporting documentation, such as receipts or photos, as required by Fla. Stat. §83.49(3)(a).
2.  **Vague Language:** The use of vague language like “damage to walls,” “missing items,” “excessive garbage,” and “spoiled food” without specifics renders the notice insufficient and legally invalid.
3.  **Incorrect Address:** The notice included an incorrect zip code for the response address, delaying my ability to respond within the statutory timeframe. This was not a simple clerical error but a calculated move to obstruct my right to due process.
4.  **Failure to Disclose:** You failed to disclose the financial institution holding the security deposit, whether it was interest-bearing, or if you own over five properties in Florida, as required by law.

**B. Unlawful Deductions:**

1.  **Speculative Damages:** You attempted to use future expenses and speculative damages as a basis for security deposit deductions, which is not permitted under Florida law.
2.  **Lack of Breakdown:** You failed to provide a detailed breakdown of individual costs, making it impossible to determine if amounts claimed were reasonable.
3.  **Withholding Without Justification:** You withheld the entire security deposit of $4,500 without providing proper justification or evidence of damage.

**C. Failure to Provide Evidence:**

1.  **Subsequent Letters:** Despite claiming in your second letter that you have ample photos, witnesses, and documentation to support your claims, you again failed to produce any such evidence.
2.  **Bad Faith:** Even after being given a second opportunity to supply detailed information, you did not present the necessary proof, suggesting bad faith and an unwillingness to be transparent.

**III. UNLAWFUL RETENTION & CONVERSION OF PERSONAL PROPERTY**

Your actions regarding my personal property are a clear violation of Florida law and demonstrate a blatant disregard for my ownership rights.

**A. Failure to Provide Notice:**

1.  **Violation of Fla. Stat. §715.104:** You did not provide the required written notice to me regarding personal property left behind, violating Fla. Stat. §715.104.
2.  **Lack of Itemization:** You failed to specify the items left behind and offer a reasonable timeframe for retrieval.

**B. Conversion of Property:**

1.  **Unlawful Retention:** You unlawfully retained my personal property, including a Weber grill, and used it to market the rental property, which constitutes conversion under Florida law.
2.  **Unauthorized Use:** Your use of my personal property for your benefit is a clear violation of my ownership rights.

**C. Shifting Burden of Proof:**

1.  **Misrepresentation:** You attempted to shift the burden of proof to me by requesting evidence that my personal property was left on the premises, when the burden is on the landlord to prove that the property was not there or that it was abandoned.
2.  **Bad Faith:** This attempt to shift the burden of proof is a misrepresentation of legal requirements and a clear indication of bad faith.

**D. Misrepresentation of Abandonment:**

1.  **Partial Quotation:** You used a partial quote of a text message to suggest I abandoned the property, which is a misrepresentation and omission of the full context.
2.  **Intent to Retrieve:** The full context of my message clearly shows my intent to retrieve my belongings, not abandon them.

**IV. LANDLORD NEGLIGENCE & BREACH OF HABITABILITY**

Your failure to maintain the premises in a safe and habitable condition is a direct violation of Florida law and demonstrates a reckless disregard for my safety and well-being.

**A. Failure to Maintain Premises:**

1.  **Clogged Sink:** You neglected maintenance issues, such as a severely clogged kitchen sink, despite being notified. This forced me to resolve the issue myself.
2.  **Security Concerns:** You failed to address security concerns after a break-in, despite my requests for improved gates and security cameras. You acknowledged the need for a secure gate but then reversed your commitment. You also limited my ability to install security cameras.
3.  **Breach of Implied Warranty:** By failing to address the security concerns and maintenance issues, you breached the implied warranty of habitability under Fla. Stat. §83.51.

**B. Specific Incidents of Neglect:**

1.  **January 2024:** A severely clogged kitchen sink rendered the property unsanitary for 15 days. You failed to arrange repairs, forcing me to handle the issue independently.
2.  **March 2024:** Faulty motion lights and deteriorated gates facilitated a violent home invasion. Despite acknowledging these safety concerns, you took no action to address them.
3.  **April 2024:** Overhanging tree limbs above outdoor electrical cables created hazardous conditions. Neglected vegetation, including bamboo, an alleged jackfruit tree, and other trees, added to safety risks.

**V. LANDLORD MISCONDUCT & HARASSMENT**

Your actions demonstrate a pattern of harassment and a deliberate attempt to undermine my legal rights.

**A. Unwanted Communication:**

1.  **Unsolicited Contact:** You engaged in frequent unsolicited communications, including phone calls and text messages, after being asked to communicate only through certified mail, which constitutes harassment.
2.  **Disregard for Request:** This disregard for my request and the use of unsolicited phone calls exacerbated my PTSD.

**B. Misrepresentation of Legal Process:**

1.  **Coercion:** You attempted to coerce me into a phone call by implying the law requires us to be amicable, which is false.
2.  **Misleading Statements:** You misrepresented the legal process to gain an undue advantage.

**C. Emotional Distress:**

1.  **Aggravation of PTSD:** Your actions caused significant emotional distress, exacerbating my pre-existing PTSD.
2.  **Intentional Harm:** Your actions were not merely negligent but a deliberate attempt to cause emotional distress.

**VI. PROFESSIONAL MISCONDUCT & ETHICAL VIOLATIONS**

Your actions as a licensed attorney raise serious ethical concerns and potential bar violations.

**A. Misrepresentation as a Lawyer:**

1.  **Email Address:** Your use of the email address “luther2law@gmail.com” implies you are acting as a lawyer in this matter, potentially constituting misrepresentation.
2.  **Attempt to Intimidate:** This could be an attempt to shield yourself from scrutiny while retaining the benefits of appearing to be a lawyer.

**B. Violations of Florida Bar Rules:**

1.  **Dishonesty and Misrepresentation:** As an attorney, your actions may violate the Florida Bar Rules of Professional Conduct, specifically Rule 4-8.4(c) (prohibiting conduct involving dishonesty or misrepresentation).
2.  **Prejudicial Conduct:** Your actions may also violate Rule 4-8.4(d) (prohibiting conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice).

**VII. LACK OF TRANSPARENCY & BAD FAITH**

Your actions demonstrate a clear lack of transparency and bad faith.

**A. Failure to Provide Evidence:**

1.  **Withholding Documentation:** Despite claiming to possess photos, receipts, and witness accounts, you failed to provide any supporting documentation to substantiate your claims, even after multiple opportunities.
2.  **Undermining Claims:** This lack of evidence undermines your ability to assess claims and demonstrates a lack of transparency.

**B. Arbitrary Settlement Offer:**

1.  **Insufficient Offer:** Your arbitrary settlement offer of $2,000 lacks any legal basis and does not address the full extent of your liabilities.
2.  **Bad Faith:** This offer demonstrates a clear intent to avoid accountability and to unlawfully retain my funds.

**VIII. REBUTTAL OF SPECIFIC DAMAGE CLAIMS**

Your claims of property damage are vague, unsubstantiated, and fail to meet the legal requirements for a valid claim.

**A. Damage to Walls:**

1.  **Lack of Specificity:** You claim damage to walls without specifying the nature, location, or extent of the damage.
2.  **Normal Wear and Tear:** I deny causing any damage beyond normal wear and tear, which tenants are not responsible for under Florida law.

**B. Removal of Fixtures:**

1.  **Temporary Fixtures:** You claim I removed wood cabinets, shelving, and counters without prior written consent. I acknowledge removing temporary fixtures installed for organization but was prepared to restore the premises or compensate.
2.  **Lack of Communication:** My attempts to communicate were ignored, demonstrating your bad faith.

**C. Excessive Garbage:**

1.  **External Factors:** You claimed excessive trash, which was due to delayed collection caused by external factors like storms.
2.  **Proper Disposal:** All trash was placed in the designated area, demonstrating my compliance.

**D. Spoiled Food:**

1.  **Minimal Items:** You mentioned spoiled food in the refrigerator, which was minimal and not causing damage.
2.  **Normal Turnover:** Minor cleaning is considered normal turnover and does not justify withholding the security deposit.

**E. Missing/Damaged Items:**

1.  **Lack of Inventory:** You alleged missing and damaged artwork, furnishings, and housewares without an initial inventory, making claims unenforceable.
2.  **Unreasonable Accountability:** Holding me accountable for undocumented items at move-in is unreasonable and potentially unlawful.

**F. Misrepresentation of Text Message:**

1.  **Selective Quotation:** You misused a text message to imply property abandonment, contrary to my intent to retrieve belongings.
2.  **Intent to Retrieve:** The full context of the message shows my intent to retrieve my belongings, not abandon them.

**G. Tenant’s Proactive Actions:**

1.  **Forced Repairs:** I was forced to undertake repairs due to your negligence, like fixing a clogged sink.
2.  **Landlord Negligence:** Your negligence forced me to take on these repairs, making you responsible for issues that would have been your responsibility if you had acted proactively.

**IX. ZACH STEINBERGER’S COMPROMISED POSITION**

1.  **Commission Structure Influence:** Mr. Steinberger’s financial stakes in the transaction created a strong incentive to favor your positions.

**B. Unauthorized Legal Activities:**

1.  **Security Deposit Opinion:** Mr. Steinberger’s recommendation to withhold the entire security deposit was an unauthorized legal opinion, exceeding his professional expertise.
2.  **Property Condition Assessment:** His move-out inspection and damage claims were made without professional certifications or qualified verification.

1.  **Documentation Deficiencies:** Mr. Steinberger failed to provide a proper inventory list, move-in photos, or professional inspection reports.

You have **15 days** from the receipt of this letter to remit the full payment. Failure to comply will result in the immediate filing of a lawsuit in circuit court, where I will seek maximum allowable damages, including treble damages, punitive damages, attorney fees, and court costs.

I will not engage in further informal discussions or mediation without full payment. Your continued noncompliance will only exacerbate your legal and financial exposure.

Sincerely,
