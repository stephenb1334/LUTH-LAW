  PO Box #3097

Written July 7, 2023

- The Assumed Business Certificate, filed in North Carolina, at the Catawba County's Recorder of Deeds, contained a handwritten official business address for the appropriate field. The county's instructions specified that no PO Box was allowable, making the strong, clear assertion that a PO Box address for an entity to be considered, and approved, for the rights associated with the approval status of Assumed Business Names would not allow for the entity address to be a federally issued PO Box by the United States Postal Service.

- The Assumed Business Certificate provided by Luther Rollins, Jr. & Mary O. Polk submitted on July 7, 2023, provided the address as follows:

  231 Government Ave. S.W.  
  #3097  
  Hickory, NC 28603-3097

- No "PO Box" is used
- USPS records indicate that 28603 is reserved solely for PO Boxes issued at the USPS physical location in Hickory, NC that uses 28602 for its own delivery zone building designation in the city of Hickory, NC while maintaining rights to issue 28603 zip codes, under Federal Mailing law, to PO Box renters at that USPS location.

- The Assumed Business Certificate was a submission for approval provided to Catawba County's Recorder of Deeds for consideration on July 7, 2023
- Approval was noted in public databases with an approval date of July 14, 2024
- This approval provides the legal right for the three entities, and its officers, to conduct business in all North Carolina Counties under three Doing Business As (DBA), or Assumed Business Names.

- Assumed Business Names applied for, and provided approval, were as follows:

  - Amarlu Company (SOS ID: 2668508)

  - Amarlu Consulting (SOS ID: 2668509)

  - Amarlu Enterprises (SOS ID: 2668507)

- Due to its omission, the approval was despite the address being a PO Box in the application.
- This approval was despite the misuse of "-3097" as the secondary USPS Delivery Zone Designation

Final Best Assumed Address:

  231 Government Ave. S.W.  
  PO Box #3097  
  Hickory, NC 28603
