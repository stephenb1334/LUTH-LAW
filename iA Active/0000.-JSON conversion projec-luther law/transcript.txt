below transcript uses numbers like "399" and "three nine nine" and "433" and "four thirty three" and similar. They are to be understood as equaling $399,000 and $433,000 as the discussion is around real estate prices not products for $3.99 or $4.33. 

Transcript below: 

So let me let me give you the the example of what I did with uh the property uh the over and not Fortley that I did Okay? Uh I mean you can draw some, you know creative inspirational's out of that but I think it's gonna be a different scenario. Uh but I want to ask you what this meant You said that it's this is the last piece between you and your wife, uh to be finished meaning this is the last piece to finalize the divorce Is that what you're saying? Yeah It's it's the biggest piece on the table for cert for certain Yeah. Okay.
So that kind of changes the dynamic a little bit over here Okay So, you know I don't know what the what kind of…
you know um, thoughts that you know it's running in your wife's mind but I think you know from her standpoint…
she feels that you know because she was married with you for a certain amount of time that she's still entitled to receive some kind of proceeds from the sale of this property here she's going to want us to see this being sold at the uh you know the highest point on here But I think the the real estate agent, um you know I think…
And, uh I I think she kinda missed out on couple, uh key critical things in terms of a situation that you and your wife are on Okay I've seen that this is a divorce case and need the so fast And for her to think that you know dropping a thousand dollars to realign the logarithms for the shows to come up um you know I I think that's very foolish Okay Because what happens is that
…
you know when you have when you put when you put a property out in the in the market, okay, your first thirty days says it all Okay? A good property will get an offer within thirty days Okay? Even if the price is high someone's gonna put an offer in okay and they're gonna lowball you Okay? So you know people see that offer a local offer as an insult but it's it's you know it's not a insult It's a gaze to say hey it's a desirable property that somebody wants to move in there Okay? So with to the first thirty dates if you get no offers, okay, there's two things Okay One being we're gonna be three things Okay Uh one of the three things that could be uh is price okay the condition of the property and school district Okay Depending on you know what pool it is that's running me up to offer.
But generally in Old City okay there are usually young couples, Uh or they're you know they don't have early children, or they're either very young or very old again nothing in between because they wanna move to the suburbs if they have a family Okay Right So the school elements taken out of this equation on here So it comes up to two things price and good condition of the proper fee Okay? And the commission to the property will also include HOA because here's what happens with HOA's. The older the building, the more maintenance there is the higher the HOA fee Okay? And the newer it is the less maintenance the lower the HOA fee the that's just how HOA feeds go Okay? So given the situation on here okay if you buy this house at let's say uh
you know for this this, even the uh even at the you know the numbers on Let's say that you buy this at four hundred Okay? And seven percent mortgage on here Okay? We're looking at about five thousand dollar monthly bill plus a thousand dollars of HOA and other you know utilities and all that kind of stuff out on here That puts us at sixty thousand dollars Whoa How do you get how do you get to five thousand on a four four hundred thousand, um property It's seven percent Okay Seven percent mortgage rate Okay So somewhere around there Okay So you know people are gonna be looking at about five thousand dollars a month
…
we bill to live in that pro to live in that property That's we're just rough estimating on here Yeah Okay? Now, so either a you're gonna think okay If we wanna live in this area, because we like the area, can we rent a property, uh and get something for five thousand bucks okay or does it make more sense to buy the property and have you know building your you know equity in…
there
…
Okay? But on this situation on here when I just looked at the pictures on there okay Um it looks like it's well painted okay and it's clean but it's missing the amenities of a quote unquote old city
…
condo. Okay I'm just missing the bells and whistles on on there Okay? So to put all the bells and whistles to capture and captivate the you know the what brings her to uh the whole city on here you know an average homeowner, a person who's gonna buy that is gonna hire a contractor…to beautify that house so then put the things that you guys won't do and your wife won't need to do Okay? And see that everything is all damn expensive right now Okay You're looking at the bill of anywhere from my seventy to a hundred thousand to do that job there Okay? So then that's an extra cost of money So these are all the stuff that people are thinking as as a result of you know what uh prior to buying the property And end of the day they're gonna
…
okay this is gonna go this is gonna be the money that we need to be able to look at the student here okay, versus, um you know moving into a house or a condo that's already been you know you know all fixed up and they can just move in and have one uh mortgage payment and they don't have to worry about anything else there Okay? So when a homeowner moves into a house okay they're gonna want to say that hey you know if I have to fix up this house and there's something I
…
do I have to get it you know I there's gonna be some building equity for me to buy to incentivize to buy this house on here Okay? So I think those are things that your realtor is really misaligning on here Just thinking that that the market in you know old city is hot. Okay? Certain properties in the market in old city are hot Okay Those are move in condition ready to just you know live and and not worry about anything else Okay
…
And on top of that the timing of what needs to be done on here you know I mean you're in a diverse situation and you know and you know you gotta do this thing on here So the reason I'm just saying all these things on here is not to you know to paint the picture that you already know, What I'm seeing here is that given that situation on here to get this thing done is just simple Creative you know way of selling this on here is gonna take a long process
…
The best thing to get this thing done on here is to reduce the price on the property and get it just fire sold. Okay And seeing that you're the you know the uh you know you're the you know the master of the puppy on here because it's your finances that you know buy the property on here and you have to say, it's better to just reduce the price and to get this thing over and done with it and take a you know a reduced uh properties I mean you know a price reduction between you know like four thirty three and four fifty
…
fifteen It's fifteen thousand dollars and I know that's a lot of money But given in terms of the price of real estate you know uh a fifteen thousand dollar offer or you know running down a uh fifteen thousand dollar you know price
…
point is not that whole heck of a lot when it comes to a home at this price point here Okay It's common to reduce properties by ten thousand dollars incentivize for someone to come in and put an offer in Okay If you really thought that four fifty
…
eighteen is going to be the price point that's going to sell. Somebody would have already written an offer for four Like somebody between like four hundred and four fifteen if it's listed at four thirty three Okay? It's not uncommon for homes that are you know in the four ranges with uh you…
know be, you know uh like four thirty three to thirty three thousand dollars in the low range to get an offer where they're gonna put it anywhere between my four hundred to four fifty to see where the seller's gonna be at and then open up for negotiations on here Okay? Steve I'll be honest with you I hate to be the burden though I hate to be the highest with the bad news on here but I think even if you listed this at three ninety nine you're gonna get an offer for like three seventy five. Okay Um because…
you know the situation is that…this is on the fourth floor you said Yes Okay So think about in terms of the contractor wise okay uh they're gonna have to you know, redo
…
I don't I don't know what the floors are like okay but um you know I think you said it's hardwood floor but let's just assume that they're gonna do all the walls the plumbing, and they're gonna you know redo the whole uh the uh the whole kitchen on there Okay You can't piece mail in a home like this Again so the countertop's fine, you know but we're just gonna replace the top counter cabinets and not the you either rehab the whole thing the whole kitchen or you know you just you're just gonna leave it as is. Okay. They'll they'll the appliances, the stove and all that kind of that's that's small stuff I mean that's that's you know best buy will come in you know, deliver that up before and all that kind of stuff Okay? But what I'm seeing here from in terms of a contractor, it's going to be a big burden, and it's gonna delay the job, and it's gonna be that ease of convenience of fixing the house from a contractor standpoint It's gonna be a lot difficult um, to go to the fourth floor using the service elevator, and as long as there's a elevator or something like that It's just a big hassle for the contract and the numbers that are coming behind because of that K I mean contractors definitely you know look at the new There's not even a service con a service elevator It's just a single elevator It's very small and stairwell. That's it.
So it it's they're gonna really, you know see that that guys it's gonna be a really hard you know pay the ass to take you know travel team and you know those you know cement board for like you know for the bathroom and you know um
all the material of the paint the cabinets and different corners and all all that shit that needs to go along with you know moving things up to the fourth floor there Okay? So, you know, that's the difficulty of it Okay Now the other side of it is you know uh you're in a situation that you don't wanna put any more money into this and you don't have to Okay So you're at the last month on here. Okay And what it comes down to is is that you know prices are what's gonna incentivize for buyers to come in and do this And you know from a standpoint if a homeowner wanting to build a sweat equity there are far few…
betweens
…
especially in the old city Okay People in the old city you know they have money They wanna spend that money Could be moved into a house that's already all done and they just wanna enjoy, you know the house that they live in Okay? This is gonna be for an investor that's gonna be one of the come in and fix the property up Okay…
I don't know what the uh the back the market price of the property is Okay I'm assuming it's you know four thirty three since it's listed at that point there Okay But the competition is this okay in Old City and all around that area there
…
Okay? People are just buying up old shit and and they're buying that shit up at really good price and they're just we have the heck out of it to tie the new houses. And those are the Chinese people that are doing that stuff. Okay Um, you know I know like this this one guy um you know um, and he's an older guy. Uh and you know for him and his partners, you know they buy like old warehouses.
They knock it down They put all handling in something And that makes sense because you know it's condos each unit you know you know if you do a per unit cost and stuff like that you know they they make like you know a nice chunk of change for each unit and and it's do that So this is a a stickler on here Okay? Creative stuff This is what I did with my property here Okay So I had a condo It was two bedroom two bath Um it was like like hair over eleven other square feet on that Okay Um you know
…
Here here's what here was what here's what was going for that house there. The condo…had, uh a kick heads view of the Hudson River And if you look and then if you look across the Hudson River you can see a Columbia University So it was awesome view
…
If you go downstairs there's this like boardwalk kind of thing where you can walk around to the Hudson River and you know and you could walk to coffee shops and it was all nice and and blah blah But the property was old Okay The window…Uh would it would it would it would thunderstorm? You could hear like the hiss…coming, uh you know coming through the window because like the caulking the rubber caulking it's a special window…
What's that That's our condo Same as a draft on these huge huge windows and um same thing. Yeah There's a special kind of windows made for condos that resist like wind under someone a high rise, My shit was on like the seventeenth floor you know So the those like windows per pop were like five grand Right I'm just like what the hell you know? So what I ended up doing was and on top of that Steve okay? There's HOA and there's camping And those things were no…joke Okay? So I bought that thinking oh what what what you know what's gonna cause to you know rehab four walls.
Right That's I mean I was so naive by that. And I had bought this thing and I'm like holy cow you know it it's like it was so much more work than I thought it was So I did the basic amenities. Right And you know I I bought this thing at cheap and price Okay I mean, But the bad thing was is that, um it was the foreclosure debacle of two thousand and eight that's really a sacrifice And nobody was qualified for a mortgage at that time Right I mean like people who qualified for a mortgage they were moving into like you know like you know nice houses but they're not gonna be moving into nice like luxury houses Okay? So you know even if I bought this at you know like three forty or somewhere around that age range on there okay I couldn't feasibly see myself…
selling this at like five you know I thought I was gonna be able to sell a six and there was gonna be a lottery ticket but you know um you know it wasn't either full. So what I ended up doing was that I put this out of the market for rent Okay And one thing that was good about that rental market is that I know that there's a lot of people that live in New York that wanna live in, um you know um in Fort Lee because the ferry is right there Right They don't you know they just take the ferry commute and they come there. But you know I there was another detail that I didn't know which was they you know, those are the people who live in residential houses that they do that This was a condo They don't raise family in the condo So these are like young married couple and young married couple they wanna live in the bling blinghouse not the one that I had Okay? So there's a lot of similarities between you and art And ultimately what I ended up doing was is that, um
, I had So I I so you know so I found a tenant for that and the tenant…was, um they lived for a year okay, uh and they moved out Okay They got tired of you know like, for like, like five hundred dollars more they can get a newer looking you know um property or newer looking you know condo So that's what they did So I lost that tenant. And that thing sat vacant for like year and a half. Okay? Year and a half passes by. And they're gonna redo the carpet in all the floors Okay And every unit was you know was stuck with a bill for thirty thousand dollars Okay See I was not feeling good brother Okay?
So what I ended up doing was is that…
I'm at um my brother, uh worked at Samsung, the headquarters in Korea. Okay He was um, and he was like the vice president of the actuarial department back out there And they were sending a lot of actuaries…to the Samsung office in New York and they were looking for like, uh short term or long term leases like that And I ultimately found this guy through my brother who…would come in here, not through Samsung, uh actuarial side not not the insurance side but Samsung electronics. It was coming here for a year. Okay? And if he passes the year he's gonna get a long term position in the United States So what I did was that I sold back to him, I I did a rent to own, okay where, uh we agreed on the price ahead of time and you know I gave him a lease option where if he exercises that you know option, that he's gonna buy it at a fixed price That's gonna be a little bit lower than the market price there.
So year comes by and he didn't get the full time offer but he still wants to stay there for another So I renew that with another option fee. And all this stuff received was all you know all this stuff was basically paying the bill there Okay Real estate taxes there are like forty grand a year Okay? So, you know what was happening with this guy here was just you know keeping me afloat you know breaking even on there And then I you know I ultimately exercised the ops…
and I ended up making small change but you know given the time that how much money went into the house and how long I held it for and the aggravation that I got it for okay um it just did not it didn't equal
…
the amount of money that I made on that Now funny thing was, three years later after I sold that that doubled in value Okay So talk about a kick in the ass Right? Uh it doubled under I would've gotten like eight hundred thousand dollars for that house. Okay? The reason why is the reason why on the uptake my thing wasn't sound is because right around that area they were building brand new condos Okay They were building brand new thickened condos and they were showing up
…
People wanted to buy that not my stuff Okay? And after those brand new condos filled up that raised the value of the condo price. And then they had no other condos to buy and they were buying properties like me So if I stuck it up for three more years, know I would have gotten the number that I was looking for But in hindsight, I look at this and this is the point that I make it to you Steve Right? You know there's one issue is is that you know you're going through uh you know life situation where where you and your wife are you know parting ways um…
uh and you know obviously it seems something that you know that you wanna take care of ASAP you know to do And secondly is that this is gonna be foreign you know
…
Uh you you know it's something like that spoon that's gonna be keep like rubbing on you and until like you know it it it is finally it exhausts you Okay And what I'm seeing here is that where it's gonna exhaust you
…
Where it's gonna take you to is the numbers that I'm mentioning right now. Okay? And before you go through another you know couple months of, you know you know the the you know the pain in there as part of the difficulty of uh you know going through this on here, What I really think it makes sense in my opinion and I'm no real estate agent or anything like that This is just from a standpoint uh from a real estate you know investor and the you know the problem that I went through when I bought that you know condo for Lee is that It's a situation where um you know that it's just better to get that number low Can you sell this in as is condition okay um and you know and and someone's gonna come in and it's gonna…
incentivize
…
for homeowner to buy this property, um you know that they feel the value of you know putting sweat equity in here It could build this house up to a nice property on here. I think that's the best situation on here. What I would think that you know what I would recommend is this k, I would change your agent Okay Uh the only reason I say that is because you don't want an agent that's tied to your wife as well and then keep going back to four
…
and and causes a friction on that Okay I I think you know if I mean if you need an agent I have a kick ass agent out there I mean he's a fucking hustler. And um you know and I think he'll tell you the same kind of thing that I would uh basically tell you but My point is is that you know hey what is that number that you know that yeah It sucks It's not the number that you want but what is that number that you can deal with to say hey it's a low number I don't like it but it gets me off the burden of having this on my bag that's gonna cause can constantly cause friction between you know my wife or not and imparting a ways and starting a new chapter in my life I think that's that's the best situation to do Steve. I agree with you. I agree with you across the board from the from the realtor to and you know she's done okay but it's the it's all the things that you said the alignment you know um it's just getting a clean fresh
…
you know person to grab their hands around it put it out a number as is is critical. Um what would you market it what would be you know I'll I'll a let me get that number please and introduce um I would love to
…
I made a couple calls today but if you could please make that introduction. But what do you think um that number is And really for me, the pain is so great And from Melissa the pain is so great to be hanging on to this And it's greater for me because I'm paying the bill but you know in six months from now if I accept three seventy five I'm gonna you know right now I'm I've already been listening for two hundred and ten days We should have listed it at four hundred six months ago, you know because I agree. You know and so um I can't sustain another six months or of paying this mortgage And so you can't make this mistake again if you look at it as six months batches here So reduce it And as long as I'm not you know making money on this is not my prerogative Um of course it'd be…nice…
But, uh as long as I'm not cutting a check to get out…
that's that's the worst that's the worst case scenario And so um So Steve let me let me run some analysis on this Okay And you know I might even say hey you know let me make a wholesal offer on here Okay? Because I have a lot of like you know, and and Steve Okay This is not me being politically incorrect I'm just being very matter of fact here I'm Korean Okay. But Louis I don't really do well with Asian community Okay Like they don't see me in this nation. Okay Like they just I don't know They just don't accept me as an Asian It is what it is Okay? But I do have a lot of Asian buyers that want to buy…
like, they they got they just got freaking money man Okay And they just sit on money and they wanna live in a house. Okay? Um you know I can try to like work something out with them so that you know we can you know help us do do us you know for sale by owner without agent I don't have to pay the agent fee And but you know I you know I can try to like make it a thousand bucks worth marketing whatever stuff like that I know I don't know what my fee would be but Please But yeah at at least from this point on here, you know let me you know I and Steve you know like I I wouldn't like I you I wouldn't show you as like a seller where you know I'm trying to trying to get this thing as low as possible as my wholesale fees but I wouldn't do that Okay I would just be very you know upfront It's just like, See if I think this is number that it's gonna sell at okay if you're gonna have your wholesale at okay I probably would market a business This is what I would try to make off of that I would just totally disclose that to you Okay I mean I think it's just a fair situation to do that at you know…
Um and Let me run that analysis on there but I think, you know the given the circumstances on here um I I think it's like one of the such a like situation. And you know as a wholesaler, you know when you're dealing with like an abundance I don't think you know, I see this stuff situation a lot even on a smaller scale even on on a smaller Ricky like a hundred fifty thousand dollar house where like you know um you know two people got you know uh together and they got married and you know…
whether it's the wife the husband, uh puts up the uh you know the you know the to purchase the price And it's so ironic and I'm not saying that you know wife is like this That's not what I'm insinuating, but it seems to me that the person who has the like the least amount of money the one that wants to get the most that's not out of the money Right? And they're the one who's gonna you know, they're they're the they're gonna be the one that's gonna be yelling and yelling the most Saying…
you know the agent said this the agent said that you know my dad knows this you know neighbor who's the neighbor's you know veterinarians, wife's cousins, you know a family member, cousins nephews. It's a real estate agent and he's a top broker. And they said you can get this What would you say You they're the one who makes the most noise on here Okay? So the key critical thing that I'm trying to say to you is that all the way through, your ex wife okay is going to be saying Why the hell are you selling it for this price She wouldn't even say that if he got an offer for four thirty three She would be saying like well then you should counter f you know four four four forty. Okay If he got an offer for four forty so he said like well we should try to get four fifty.
It's just one of those situations. Right? So either way you in any way that you did this you would never never uh you know in my you know without even knowing your wife at all Okay Just heard the experience of things that I've seen, that you would never appease to your wife and what she wants to get because ultimately she wants to get as much as that that she can possibly get And her decision process is not on actual factual thing
…
It's upon, you know greed is basically what it is to get the most money to put in the pocket so that you know when you guys part ways, you know her wallet is tied in as much as possible on there Okay? And you know and then it's I'm not saying that you know she's being greedy or I'm not saying your wife is like or anything like that It's just you know just have humans on when they you know end the chapter in their life and they wanna move on And it just seems to be the you know the profile of how things go But given this situation on here, um, I think you know, you know what what what the main point that I'm making here is is that this is a pain point that you just don't want to be in anymore because the longer that you're in it hoping that you're gonna get closer to a desired number of a property there's other issues that's gonna
…
keep nabbing at you, and it's just gonna be you know it's just gonna drive you crazy even more And you have to say hey, what is that point that I'm not willing to put up with on here Okay What is that point that I need to move on and just you know I have a first start with my life on here you know. Um and I think that's what it is And it doesn't mean to say that you know someone's naive or you know someone's you know less aggressive or somebody's just you know letting you know they're ever said They're not it's not like that at all It's just about moving on to a new chapter man, you know um…
you know like I can tell you about you know I I can tell you about a rehab property that, uh that I did you know and I'm very conservative…you know when I do rehab the clear conservative meaning that, you know um you know I, you know I make my profit more just small I blow it up my repair cost…so that you know the number that I'm looking at is a small profit number But if I'm wrong I'm making a bigger…and that's how I kinda go into uh you know rehabbing And this one property that I you know that you know that that I rehabbed on here Steve the pinpoint was that fucking thing man
…
That was just driving me insane on here Okay And end of the day I made a profit of seven hundred bucks Okay Seven hundred bucks after a rehab on
…
that. Okay? But for me it was like you know something clearly there were things on that rehab that I would never ever do that again I would never do a remote rehab
…
again If I were to do it you know there's a lot more you know check the balances and controls that I need to put in there But it was worth it for me as long as I'm not just like you said as long as I'm not running a check to excel that house I was okay letting that…
go
…
Okay So my greatest two you know pain point in my real estate investing career is that Fort Lee proper in a Winston Drive okay and um and that remote uh you know rehab that I did And you know it's like these are one of those things when you look back five years from now You're like you know I don't mind letting that property go for what I'd let go on here I don't mind that I have a
…
you know a clean sense of mind I don't have to worry about But you know you start to collect and say and you know Steve you know one thing that I knew about you you're very articulate. K? Uh you speak like very well. And your your intelligence level man is very high Even when you know like when I was teaching you things you just collected information And I love how you collected information that I gave you and you could express that back you know telling me that
…
you understood exactly what I was talking about, and you have that level of intelligence And I think it's gonna be one of those things to say hey you know what something? This is what I got out of that This is what I need to get out of it five years from now And I think you're gonna walk away with this shit and realizing that hey, it's a very, you know good experience Would I learn out of that Do I wish that I'd go through that I get absolutely not Okay But I think that's where you're gonna be at with
…
to check your life And I think you said it best Okay You just don't wanna be in a situation where you have to write a check to uh you know sell the house on here. K Mhmm So I'll I'll run some analysis, uh you know on on this property on here but You know the question that you really have to ask is is that where you're at that you don't wanna write a check to sell the house or is there a price point that you're you wanna see it I mean you know I mean if you know realistically is what I'm trying to say I mean we wanna get you you know high so no amount of money possible for this property on here but You know, um, you know let me see what you know what other things that we can do even if I try to wholesale and stuff like that you know um let me see you know what we can make out of this on here And I'm glad to help you know I'd be more than happy to help you as Yeah I'll I'll I'll hold back on you know throwing out numbers for now Obviously um
money is better for this situation than than not But and it's interesting to get this advice from you which is phenomenal advice
…
But then if you run an analysis also uh to work together but I think because of our past together and I think um because of how things kind of uh fell apart And but with the investment that was made in this
…
even the time spent with you learn so much. Um I'd like to work together I have full trust in you Kyle Um just like you said you're gonna bring me the numbers of different situations but I'm ex my come on is open
…
Right And so um let uh work with me and make some money, um and just be as I would expect transparent with the numbers And then um I won't have any any concern It's a it's blessing just to hear this advice You
…
articulated that so well and I connected with so much of it and you reinforced what my gut is on this. Um…
so I'm gonna I my my cards right now are on the table and I'm gonna pause…Well I'll talk to that realtor You know keep things moving, um until I hear from you But what are the next steps Because I'm in action mode here So um what do you suggest So first first off I think you know um and this is me telling us
…
a friend not as a uh an investor Okay So this isn't a professional opinion because it's technically unethical because I'm not a licensed agent Okay But as a friend I'm sorry that realtor Okay She can't get a she can't get an offer this long and she's
…
going back and forth with thousand dollars because she wants to reset the logarithm. Like come on That that's just…that that's just you know I mean after sixty days she should have said Steve and go and do your wife and say let's take a heart to heart talk on here Do you wanna sell this house or not Okay? Clearly these are the reasons that we've gotten back that you know people aren't interested on here Okay This is what the market's doing on here. These houses are selling in thirty days and this is what the these houses look like within thirty days These are the houses that's not selling This is how long it's taking. Here's where your property's at You don't want motivates people It's the price We need to down that price She should've been very real with you you know.
But there was like a lot of shit that was going on with the real estate agent with their commissions data Some kinda got weird about it and Yep And you know and all that kind of stuff you know But you know the point that you know that I'm making here is is that uh
I I I think he need another agent if that's the angle that we go Okay So we can always find an agent with that Right I mean that's the easiest part Right So letting this agent go when you know that she's not qualified to work with you I think that's the first sec second Okay In between that time let me see what I could do as a you know as a wholesaler
…
as an investor, okay and see if we can drop something up there Okay And if we can't then I'm gonna introduce you to a kick ass real estate agent who's gonna be there And when I say kick ass this is what I mean You know
…
kick ass real estate agents on real estate agents that find their call and pull things out of their AS kick ass real estate agents are the ones that are very realistic and say the things that that you don't didn't know the client doesn't wanna hear but is gonna get that house sold. Right
…
So like like my doctor was so funny because right around the time that I met you right Like I remember going to um go to my doctor and I had this like awesome doctor Right And uh and and he was like you know with this blood exam so just
…
doing my age check thing whatever And you know cholesterol kinda came in high Right It's like it re right in a meeting where it's supposed to be it's the high stock So I goes like damn are you gonna give me some cholesterol medicine or what And he goes like no man Go extra I'm losing weight Right And I'm like oh I'm like oh my bad Right But then I realized that that's the right answer Instead of him just running a script in the same sense on here You know this this you know this you know this you know Chuck is gonna be like hey you know Steve this is where we're at on here Do you wanna sell we're not you know and you know I'll try to do his piece and it's not working But this is where we need to be at and this is how it's gonna go And let me see what you know we can make that happen on here You know And if he's not able to do it he'll find you a very good agent that you know is able to deliver something that he may not able to do So that's what a good agent was in That's what I mean by a KS agent Does that make sense Yes That's one hundred percent So I will I can feel good about um
you know making this move
