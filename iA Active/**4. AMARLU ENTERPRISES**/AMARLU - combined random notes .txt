SUMMARY OF FACTS: AMARLU ENTERPRISES, AMARLE OMPANY, & AMARLU CONSULTANTS
A dispute involving these entities on one side, representing the interests of two individual tenants, and on the other, the landlords (Luther J. Rollins & Mary O Polk-reveals critical failures to honor Florida statutes and recognized landlord-tenant standards. The landlords' arrangement involves undisclosed foreign entities, potential misrepresentations, and possible tax infractions, all undermining the lease's enforceability under Florida law.

Landlord's Use of Mr. Zachary "Zach" Steinberger
The presence of Mr. Steinberger, a realtor potentially motivated by continued business dealings with Luther, complicates the situation. His input may be compromised by personal interests rather than an unbiased professional assessment, rendering it questionable in evaluating damages or compliance questions.

TENANT'S POSITION ON UNENFORCEABILITY OF THE LEASE
The tenant argues that the lease cannot be enforced because:
﻿﻿All rental payments were funneled through a non-disclosed and unregistered entity, violating Florida's rules for foreign entities.
﻿﻿Any claim for damages is overshadowed by these statutory breaches, likely nullifying the landlord's attempts to enforce provisions related to the security deposit or alleged damages.

Good Faith and Offset
6
The tenant fulfilled rental obligations in good faith. Should any property damages exist, they would be nominal and must be offset against any statutory violations, deposit withholdings, or other improper actions by the landlord.
LANDLORD'S CLAIM FOR ENTIRE $4,500 SECURITY DEPOSIT
Under Fla. Stat. § 83.49, landlords must give precise, itemized notices with verifiable documentation. General allegations excessi


ve trash, spoiled food, unauthorized alterations, or unverified claims about missing furnishings lack legal sufficiency if not supported by comprehensive before-and-after evidence.
Connection to Unregistered Entity
Because the landlord used a non-disclosed, unregistered foreign entity to handle a court may find the entire arrangement defective. There is limited or no stand-force the lease's clauses or to claim the security deposit in full, particularly compliant documentation.
2 Legal Analysis: Florida Landlord-Tenant Violations
Revised Legal Analysis: Florida Landlord-Tenant Violations
This section consolidates the analysis of Florida regulatory compliance issues, documented communication patterns, and legal violations, presenting a more streamlined and impactful argument.
I. Florida Regulatory Non-Compliance: A Deliberate Pattern
The landlords, Luther Rollins and Mary O. Polk, have demonstrated a clear pattern of non-compliance with Florida's landlord-tenant laws and business regulations.
This is not a case of simple oversight; it's a deliberate strategy to evade accountability and exploit tenants.
Business Registration Violations:Unregistered Foreign Entity: Amarlu Enterprises, the entity used to collect rent, is not registered as a foreign entity in Florida, a direct violation of Florida Statutes § 605.0902. This renders their business operations inII. Deceptive Communication and Address Manipulation: A Strategy of Obfusca-
tion
The landlords' communication patterns and address manipulations reveal a deliberate strategy to deceive and obstruct the tenant's ability to exercise their legal rights.
﻿﻿Certified Mail Obstruction:Failed Delivery Attempts: Multiple failed delivery attempts, USPS system rejections, and address verification failures indicate a deliberate attempt to use an invalid address. Manual Intervention: The need for personal retrieval and a USPS facility visit confirms the use of a P.O. Box, not a legitimate business address.Identity Verification: The requirement for identity verification further confirms the use of a P.O. Box, not a commercial business address.
﻿﻿Address Manipulation:P.O. Box Transition: The shift from a formal street address to a P.O. Box is a clear violation of the "No P.O. Box" mandate and a deliberate attempt to conceal their true location. Increasing Informality: The omission of the street address and the use of an incorrect zip code demonstrate a pattern of increasing informality and a disregard for proper business practices.Pattern of Evasion:
The address manipulations are a calculated attempt to evade scrutiny and complicate their paper trail.Documentation Inconsistencies: Multiple format variations, inconsistent presentations, missing required elements, and non-standardized usage of the address further demonstrate a pattern of deception and non-compliance.
III. Legal and Regulatory Violations: A Comprehensive Breach The landlords' actions constitute a comprehensive breach of both North Carolina
and Florida laws, as well as federalAddress Manipulation:P.O. Box Transition: The shift from a formal street address to a P.O. Box is a clear violation of the "No P.O. Box" mandate and a deliberate attempt to conceal their true location.Increasing Informality: The omission of the street address and the use of an incorrect zip code demonstrate a pattern of increasing informality and a disregard for proper business prac-tices. Pattern of Evasion: The address manipulations are a calculated attempt to evade scrutiny and complicate their paper trail.Documentation Inconsis-tencies: Multiple format variations, inconsistent presentations, missing required elements, and non-standardized usage of the address further demonstrate a pattern of deception and non-compliance.
**COMPREHENSIVE LEGAL ANALYSIS: SECURITY DEPOSIT CLAIM
DEFICIENCIES**
**I. IMPROPER USE OF FUTURE TENSE AND SPECULATIVE DAM-AGES**
The October 1, 2024 claim letter fundamentally violates Florida Statute
§83.49(3)(a) through pervasive use of future tense language and speculative dam-ages, rendering the entire claim legally insufficient. Florida law explicitly requires documentation of actual, incurred costs-not anticipated expenses.
**A. Systematic Pattern of Future Tense Violations**
The letter demonstrates a consistent pattern of improper future tense usage that
invalidates the claim:
1. *Cleaning Allegations*
﻿﻿"Extensive cleaning will be required"
﻿﻿Legal Impact: Confirms no actual cleaning costs incurred
﻿﻿Violation: Fla. Stat. §83.49(3)(a) requirement for actual expenses
﻿﻿No documentation of completed work or paid invoices
﻿﻿Speculative nature invalidates claim element
2. *Structural Repairs*
﻿﻿"Repairs to the walls and surfaces will be necessary"
﻿﻿No current damage assessment provided
﻿﻿Absence of contractor estimates
﻿﻿No photographic evidence
﻿﻿Future repairs cannot justify present withholding
3. *Waste Management*
﻿﻿"Garbage and trash removal will be required"
﻿﻿No documentation of existing conditions
﻿﻿No waste removal quotes obtained
﻿﻿No municipal citations or notices
﻿﻿Speculative future service cannot support current deduction
4. *Cost Calculations*
﻿﻿"Replacement costs will be calculated"

This selective quotation and misrepresentation represent a clear attempt by the landlord to avoid his legal obligations under Florida Statute §715.104234. This statute outlines the procedures a landlord must follow when a tenant leaves personal property behind, requiring written notice to the former tenant that describes the property and allows a reasonable opportunity for retrieval before disposing of the items. By misrepresenting the tenant as having abandoned their property, the landlord attempted to circumvent these statutory requirements.
The full context of the tenant's message, which the landlord deliberately ignored. clearly shows the tenant's intent to retrieve their remaining possessions. The tenant's statement, "It's the only opportunity to get the other belongings off your hands and off your property," indicates that the tenant understood their belongings remained at the property and was seeking the chance to collect the "other belongings" from the landlord. This message communicates that the tenant did not intend to abandon the property but, rather, was expressing their intention to retrieve it. The tenant's message clearly ar

retrieving their persoral property. On multiple occasions, specifically on September 25, 2024, and September 27, 2024, the tenant submitted written requests requesting ac ess to the property to collect their belongings. Unfortunately, these requests were ig nored by the landlord, who demonstrated a clear pattern of negligence and disregard or the tenant's rights. This behavior indicates a troubling intent on the part of the andlord to unlawfully withhold and convert the tenant's property for their own use.
The deliberate misrepresentation of the tenant's messages, coupled with the landlord's consistent neglect of their attempts to reclaim their belongings, illustrates a significant pattern of bad faith.

1.2 Failure to Maintain a Habitable Property
Under Fla. Stat. §83.51(1), landlords are required to ensure properties meet all building, housing, and health codes. Key incidents during my tenancy include:
﻿﻿January 2024: A severely clogged kitchen sink rendered the property unsanitary for 15 days. You failed to arrange repairs, forcing me to handle the issue independently.
﻿﻿March 2024: Faulty motion lights and deteriorated gates facilitated a violent home invasion. Despite acknowledging these safety concerns, you took no action to address them.
﻿﻿April 2024: Overhanging tree limbs above outdoor electrical cables created hazardous conditions. Neglected vegetation, including bamboo, an alleged jackfruit tree, and other trees, added to safety risks.
