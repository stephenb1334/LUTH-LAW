VERY IMPORTANT. LUTHER ROLLINS, LANDLORD, IS CONFIRMED TO BE A LAWYER, AND DO NOT STATE THAT HE IS ALLEGING HIMSELF TO BE A LAWYER, AS THIS MAY NOT BE TRUE. HE IS LICENSED IN MISSOURI AND NORTH CAROLINA, NOT FLORIDA.

The fact that Mr. Steinberger acted as both the listing agent for the home when it was for sale and later as the agent facilitating its rental could introduce concerns about conflict of interest, particularly if his dual roles influenced his advice or actions regarding the property. This dynamic could cast doubt on the objectivity of his opinions about tenant damages or his involvement in managing the property. Here’s how this potential conflict of interest could be framed to bolster your case:



This document outlines several legal claims against Luther Rollins and Mary Polk, alleging fraudulent business practices related to their rental property in Florida. The core issue is the undisclosed use of Amarlu Enterprises, a North Carolina-registered entity, to collect rent, in violation of Florida's foreign entity registration requirements. This omission from the lease and the redirection of payments to Amarlu raise concerns about tax evasion and misrepresentation to tenants. The involvement of a realtor, Zachary Steinberger, introduces a potential conflict of interest, while Rollins's status as a lawyer, while seemingly unrelated to Florida UPL violations, does not excuse the unregistered business activities of Amarlu Enterprises. The document ultimately argues that these actions constitute fraudulent concealment and non-compliance with Florida law.

Key Topics










Summary of new claims against Luther Rollins
Landlord and Entity Identification:

The lease agreement explicitly names only Luther Rollins and Mary O. Polk as landlords, acting in their individual capacities.
Despite this, rent payments were directed to Amarlu Enterprises, a North Carolina-registered entity jointly owned by Rollins and Polk, which is entirely absent from the signed lease. This omission conceals Amarlu Enterprises’ critical role in collecting rental income.
Payment Instructions and Practice:

Upon move-in, tenants received pre-stamped, pre-addressed envelopes instructing them to pay rent to Amarlu Enterprises at 231 Government Ave #3094, Hickory, NC 28602.
Over the 10-month lease term, the tenants paid a total of $45,000 in rent to Amarlu Enterprises—an entity never disclosed in the lease or mentioned as a legally recognized party in Florida.
Corporate Registration and Legal Compliance in Florida:

Amarlu Enterprises is registered in North Carolina but does not appear in the Florida Division of Corporations’ database.
Under Florida Statutes § 605.0902, any out-of-state business entity engaging in business activities, including collecting rental income from Florida property, must register as a foreign entity.
Amarlu Enterprises’ failure to register in Florida constitutes a direct violation of Florida’s foreign entity registration requirements, compromising its legal standing and the landlords’ compliance with state business laws.
Misrepresentation, Lack of Disclosure, and Tax Concerns:

Instructing tenants to pay a non-disclosed, unregistered entity (Amarlu Enterprises) undermines tenants’ understanding of their contractual obligations and potentially violates Florida’s landlord-tenant transparency laws.
Diverting rental income through an unregistered foreign entity raises concerns of possible tax avoidance or evasion. If the landlords intended to obscure the flow of income to circumvent Florida tax obligations, they may face severe legal consequences, including penalties, fines, and potential criminal charges.
Fraud and Deception:

The deliberate omission of Amarlu Enterprises from the lease agreement and the subsequent instruction to pay that entity could be construed as fraudulent. This setup potentially deceives tenants about the true nature of their rental arrangement and circumvents legal and tax obligations in Florida.
Involvement of Mr. Steinberger (Realtor):

Mr. Zachary “Zach” Steinberger of Compass Realty in St. Petersburg, Florida, has ties to these transactions, including discussions regarding future real estate dealings with Luther.
Due to his vested interest in securing listings and ongoing work with Luther, Mr. Steinberger’s involvement presents a clear conflict of interest.
As a realtor, Mr. Steinberger is not a legally recognized authority on evaluating damages or providing a professional legal opinion. His input on the matter of damages or legal compliance is therefore null and void, lacking the requisite impartiality and professional credentials to influence legal or financial assessments in this dispute.
Validation of Luther’s Legal Status:

During an April 2024 on-site walkthrough, Luther verbally affirmed his status as a lawyer practicing in corporate law. Although initially vague, he confirmed his legal background to tenant Stephen Boerner, and this was corroborated by Mr. Steinberger in a separate conversation.
It is now verified that Luther is indeed a licensed attorney with the Missouri Bar and currently practices corporate law in North Carolina as an assistant general counsel for an undisclosed corporation. Unless he represented himself as offering Florida-based legal services without authorization, there may be no violation of unauthorized practice of law (UPL) concerning Florida. His admission, however, does not mitigate the legal ramifications of conducting unregistered business operations in Florida through Amarlu Enterprises.


This excerpt lists Florida statutes frequently relevant to landlord-tenant disputes, even outside the main residential tenancy chapter (Chapter 83, Part II). It highlights statutes addressing property ownership (Chapter 82), commercial tenancies (Chapter 83, Part I), storage units (Chapter 83, Part III), landlord retaliatory actions (Chapter 83, Part IV), condominiums (Chapter 718), homeowner associations (Chapter 720), mobile home parks (Chapter 723), negligence (Chapter 768), and potential crimes like forgery and fraud (Chapters 831, 832, 837). The overall purpose is to show the broader legal context influencing residential lease disagreements in Florida, extending beyond the core landlord-tenant act itself.

Key Topics










Here are some Florida statutes that are often connected to legal disputes between landlords and tenants of residential lease agreements outside of Chapter 83, Part II:
• Chapter 82, Florida Statutes: This chapter deals with Conveyances of Land and Declarations of Trust. While not directly related to landlord-tenant disputes, it can be relevant in cases involving property ownership, title issues, or disputes over the validity of lease agreements.
• Chapter 83, Part I, Florida Statutes: Although Part II of Chapter 83 is dedicated to residential tenancies, Part I covers Nonresidential Tenancies. Disputes involving commercial properties or mixed-use buildings might reference this part, especially if there are overlapping issues or if the property has both residential and commercial units.
• Chapter 83, Part III, Florida Statutes: This part addresses Self-Service Storage Space. While not directly related to residential leases, disputes over storage units or personal property left in rental units can sometimes involve this section.
• Chapter 83, Part IV, Florida Statutes: This part deals with General Provisions. It includes sections on Retaliatory Conduct (83.64) and Prohibited Practices (83.67), which are often cited in disputes involving landlord retaliation or illegal eviction practices.
• Chapter 718, Florida Statutes: The Condominium Act can be relevant in disputes involving rental units within condominiums, particularly regarding rules, regulations, and assessments that might affect tenants.
• Chapter 720, Florida Statutes: The Homeowners’ Associations chapter can come into play if the rental property is part of a community governed by an HOA, affecting tenant rights and responsibilities.
• Chapter 723, Florida Statutes: This chapter covers Mobile Home Park Lot Tenancies, which can be relevant if the dispute involves a mobile home or manufactured home rental.
• Chapter 768, Florida Statutes: Negligence and Tort Actions can be invoked in cases where a tenant or landlord seeks damages for personal injury or property damage due to negligence or wrongful acts.
• Chapter 831, Florida Statutes: Forgery and Counterfeiting might be referenced if there are disputes over the authenticity of lease agreements or other documents.
• Chapter 832, Florida Statutes: Fraudulent Practices can be relevant if there are allegations of fraud in the rental agreement or related transactions.
• Chapter 837, Florida Statutes: Perjury might be invoked if there are disputes involving false statements made under oath in court proceedings related to landlord-tenant disputes.
These statutes, while not directly part of the Florida Residential Landlord and Tenant Act, can intersect with residential lease disputes, providing additional legal frameworks for addressing various issues that might arise in the landlord-tenant relationship.

This text argues that a real estate agent, Mr. Steinberger, had a significant conflict of interest by acting as both the listing agent for a property's sale and later its rental agent. This dual role, the argument contends, created a financial incentive for Steinberger to favor the landlord, compromising his objectivity when assessing tenant-caused damages. The text highlights that this conflict violates professional ethics outlined by the National Association of Realtors, specifically regarding neutrality and disclosure. Ultimately, the text aims to demonstrate how Steinberger's biased position weakens the credibility of his testimony regarding tenant damages in any legal dispute.

Key Topics










The fact that Mr. Steinberger acted as both the listing agent for the home when it was for sale and later as the agent facilitating its rental could introduce concerns about conflict of interest, particularly if his dual roles influenced his advice or actions regarding the property. This dynamic could cast doubt on the objectivity of his opinions about tenant damages or his involvement in managing the property. Here’s how this potential conflict of interest could be framed to bolster your case:

Conflict of Interest and Its Impact on Credibility

1. Dual Roles and Financial Incentive
• Financial Stake in Both Transactions: As the listing agent for the home when it was for sale and later as the rental agent, Mr. Steinberger had a clear financial incentive tied to the property’s value, marketability, and income potential. His commission for both the sale and rental agreements creates a perceived bias toward maintaining favor with the landlord, Luther Rollins.
• This bias undermines the neutrality required to assess tenant-related issues, particularly damages.
• His relationship with Luther as a commissioned agent inherently incentivizes alignment with the landlord’s interests, not objective fact-finding.

2. Lack of Objectivity in Assessing Tenant Damages
• Motivated to Protect Future Earnings: Steinberger’s continued role in the property’s rental management ties his financial success to his ongoing relationship with Luther Rollins. Any advice or opinions he provided about tenant damages could have been influenced by the desire to:
• Preserve his professional relationship with Luther.
• Protect the property’s future rental or resale value.
• Avoid accountability for failing to disclose property issues during its listing or rental phases.
• Undermined Credibility in Court: Courts and legal proceedings typically weigh the objectivity of witness testimony, particularly from professionals. Steinberger’s dual roles as listing and rental agent call into question whether his opinions regarding tenant damages were impartial or motivated by self-interest.

3. Professional Ethics and Realtor Guidelines
• Realtor Code of Ethics Violation: According to the National Association of Realtors (NAR) Code of Ethics:
• Article 1 obligates realtors to protect and promote the interests of their clients while being honest and fair with all parties.
• Article 11 requires realtors to perform only services for which they are qualified and to disclose their conflicts of interest.
• Article 12 prohibits false or misleading statements about the condition of a property.
• If Steinberger provided an opinion about tenant damages without sufficient inspection or expertise, or if his role as the listing agent influenced his statements, he could be seen as violating these ethical standards.

4. Conflict of Interest as a Realtor and Property Manager
• Potential Compromised Neutrality: Steinberger’s role as both the agent responsible for securing the tenant and as the property manager during the lease term makes him an inherently partial party in any disputes between the landlord and tenant. His financial incentive to maintain good standing with Luther compromises his ability to act neutrally.
• If his advice to Luther about tenant damages was overly favorable or exaggerated, it raises the question of whether he prioritized maintaining his relationship with Luther over impartial evaluation.
• This conflict weakens the credibility of any opinions Steinberger provides about tenant damages.

Using the Conflict of Interest in Your Defense

To leverage this potential conflict of interest, your argument could focus on these key points:
1. Financial Incentive and Lack of Objectivity:
• Steinberger’s dual roles as listing agent and rental agent created a financial dependency on the landlord, making his opinions about tenant damages inherently biased. Courts are unlikely to weigh opinions influenced by financial incentives as credible.
2. Undisclosed Conflict of Interest:
• Steinberger acted as both the rental agent and landlord’s representative but did not disclose this conflict of interest when providing his opinions on tenant damages. This dual role undermines his ability to act impartially and raises ethical concerns under the NAR Code of Ethics.
3. Realtor Duties and Ethical Violations:
• Steinberger’s ethical obligations under the Realtor Code of Ethics require neutrality and honesty. His financial relationship with Luther Rollins and his involvement in both the sale and rental of the property compromise his credibility and objectivity in assessing tenant damages.
4. Compromised Testimony:
• Any testimony or evidence Steinberger provides in support of tenant damages must be scrutinized through the lens of his dual roles and financial motivations. His statements should carry minimal weight unless backed by third-party evidence or formal property assessments.

Conclusion

The dual roles Steinberger held as listing agent and rental agent introduce a clear conflict of interest, significantly undermining the credibility and weight of any opinions he provided about tenant damages. His financial dependency on the landlord and his ongoing relationship with the property owner suggest his advice may have been influenced by self-interest, not impartial judgment. This conflict should be emphasized in any legal proceedings to question the validity of Steinberger’s involvement and diminish the impact of his statements or actions supporting Luther Rollins’ claims.


This text highlights discrepancies in the address information provided by Luther J. Rollins, Jr. and Mary O. Polk, owners of an assumed business name registered in Catawba County, North Carolina. Key issues include conflicting addresses—a street address with an incorrect zip code and a later provided PO Box address which violates filing regulations—and a delayed certified letter delivery due to the initial address error. These inconsistencies, including a potentially fictitious street address, raise serious concerns about the legitimacy of the business's operations and compliance with registration requirements. The overall purpose is to document these inconsistencies and suggest the need for further investigation.

Key Topics










There are several concerning issues regarding the assumed business name filings and the addresses used by Luther J. Rollins, Jr. and Mary O. Polk:

Owners of the Assumed Business Names:

According to the information provided, the two owners listed on the assumed business name filings in Catawba County, North Carolina, are:
Luther J. Rollins, Jr.
Mary O. Polk
Addresses Used:

In the initial certified letter, Luther J. Rollins, Jr. provided the address as: 231 Government Ave. SW #3097, Hickory, NC 28603-3097.
However, you mentioned that this address is incorrect, as the correct zip code should be 28602, not 28603.
Additionally, Luther J. Rollins, Jr. later provided a second letter using the address: 231 Government Ave. SW PO Box #3097, Hickory, NC 28603.
This PO Box format is inconsistent with the assumed business name filing, which states that "No P.O. Box is allowed" for the business address.
Zip Code Discrepancies:

You mentioned that while searching for the last four digits of the zip codes for both 28603 and 28602, you found the attached document, which is confusing.
The fact that the address provided by Luther J. Rollins, Jr. matches the Hickory USPS office, but there is no rentable office #3097, further adds to the confusion and raises concerns about the legitimacy of the address.
Delayed Certified Letter Delivery:

You mentioned that the certified letter was initially delayed due to the incorrect address provided by Luther J. Rollins, Jr. However, he was eventually able to retrieve it after visiting the USPS. In his second letter, Luther J. Rollins, Jr. did not provide a new address for you to send anything back, but the return address was listed as "PO Box #3097," which does not match the assumed business name filing. These discrepancies in the addresses and zip codes, along with the inconsistencies related to the assumed business name filing requirements, raise significant concerns regarding the legitimacy and compliance of the business operations. The lack of transparency, potential misrepresentation of the business addresses, and issues with certified letter delivery all indicate the necessity for a thorough investigation.


This is a strongly worded demand letter from a tenant to their landlord, who is also an attorney. The letter meticulously details numerous alleged violations of Florida landlord-tenant law, including improper handling of the security deposit, conversion of the tenant's personal property, negligence in maintaining the property, harassment, and operating an unregistered business entity. The core argument centers on the landlord's consistent refusal to provide evidence to support their claims, despite repeated requests. The tenant demands $54,200 in compensation for the alleged damages and explicitly states their intention to report the landlord to relevant professional and regulatory bodies regardless of settlement. The letter's purpose is to deliver a final demand before initiating legal action.

A DRAFT RESPONSE LETTER FOR TENANT NEXT ACTION:

Below is the integrated, comprehensive letter blending the most forceful and detailed elements from both drafts, expanded and structured as a single, coherent letter. This letter runs several pages in normal formatting. It is addressed from the tenant to the landlord, incorporating all key factual and legal points, emphasizing the landlord’s failure to produce evidence despite claiming to have it, and setting forth the tenant’s demands. The tone is firm, thorough, and final, reflecting a last opportunity before legal escalation.

December XX, 2024
Via Certified Mail – Return Receipt Requested

Mr. Luther J. Rollins, Jr.
Amarlu Enterprises
231 Government Ave. S.W., #3097
Hickory, NC 28603

RE: Property Address: 2649 Tifton St. S., Gulfport, FL 33711

Dear Mr. Rollins:

This letter serves as my final, comprehensive response to your November 8, 2024 letter and to your prior “Notice of Intention to Impose Claim on Security Deposit” from October 2024. My intent is twofold: first, to set forth a fully documented and legally grounded basis for my claims against you, and second, to offer one final opportunity to settle this matter before I proceed with all available judicial, regulatory, and professional oversight measures. Given the severity and multiplicity of your violations, this is not a negotiation but a final demand. Your previous minimal settlement offer, totaling a paltry $2,000, is flatly rejected as it utterly fails to account for the depth of your statutory noncompliance, your harassment, your conversion of my personal property, and your professional obligations as an attorney.

I. Overview of Your Statutory Violations and Professional Failures

As the landlord and an attorney, you are expected to know and follow Florida’s landlord-tenant laws. Instead, you repeatedly flouted them. Florida Statutes §§83.49 and 83.51 govern how landlords must handle security deposits and maintain habitability. Florida Statutes §§715.10–715.111 impose clear duties regarding personal property left on the premises. You neglected all these obligations. Worse, despite claiming to have comprehensive evidence—photos, inventories, time-stamped images supporting your withholding of my deposit—you never produced a shred of it, even when I formally disputed your claims and effectively granted you a second chance to comply. This stubborn refusal to provide evidence is telling. It strongly suggests your claims are baseless or contradictory to the true condition of the property.

Further, you collected rent through Amarlu Enterprises, an out-of-state entity that you never registered as a foreign LLC or business in Florida, violating Florida Statute §605.0902. This omission raises serious concerns about the legality of all rental-related transactions and your transparency. Coupled with your unauthorized, profit-driven conversion of my personal property to enhance your rental listing amenities, this pattern establishes that your misconduct is not accidental but deliberate.

Your status as a licensed attorney heightens the gravity of these violations. The Florida Bar, as well as the Missouri and North Carolina bar associations, hold attorneys to higher ethical standards. Engaging in deceptive practices, withholding legally required notices, and attempting to coerce unwritten settlements are not just civil wrongs—they may constitute professional misconduct, violating rules prohibiting dishonesty and conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice.

II. Detailed Violations

A. Improper Security Deposit Handling

Florida Statute §83.49(3)(a) requires you, as the landlord, to send a written notice of intention to impose a claim on the security deposit within 30 days after the end of the tenancy, specifying the exact nature and amount of each damage claimed. Your initial notice was vague, generic, and devoid of any itemized list. You referenced “excessive garbage,” “missing or damaged items,” and other unsupported accusations, but never provided receipts, photos, or any documentation mandated by law.

Later, in your November 8 letter, you insisted you have “everything”—photos before and after the tenancy, witnesses, receipts, inventories—yet you still refuse to produce it. If you truly possessed such definitive evidence, why withhold it? Why not present it initially when legally required, or at least after I disputed your claims, thereby curing any initial oversight? Your ongoing refusal suggests either you never had the evidence or that the evidence contradicts your claims. In either case, your withholding is in bad faith. Florida courts, faced with such refusal and evasion, are likely to order you to return the full deposit and may award me treble damages, attorney’s fees, and costs due to your bad-faith withholding.

Your new suggestion that we consider mediation is absurd given your alleged possession of incontrovertible proof. Proper timely disclosure of itemized claims and evidence would have potentially led to a swift resolution, avoiding mediation altogether. Mediation is typically for factual disputes; if your claims were truthful and verifiable, presenting the evidence would have ended this matter. Instead, withholding evidence slows the process, increases litigation costs, and further confirms your bad faith.

B. Conversion of Personal Property

Florida Statutes §§715.10–715.111 obligate landlords to provide written notice and a retrieval window before treating tenant property as abandoned. I left certain personal belongings behind and promptly requested an opportunity to reclaim them. You ignored my requests and never issued the required notice. Instead, you converted my property—specifically my Weber Spirit E-310 grill and other possessions—advertising them as amenities in your rental listing to attract new tenants.

Conversion occurs when someone unlawfully exercises dominion over another’s property. By marketing my grill to prospective tenants, you established that you retained it, are benefiting from it, and have no intention of returning it. Goodwin v. Alexatos and related case law entitles me to recover the full value of converted items. Given that you acted willfully, for personal financial gain, and in direct violation of statutes, I am also positioned to claim punitive damages for conversion.

Again, your failure to produce any documentary backup here—no inventory, no photos showing alleged abandonment—further proves the unlawfulness of your conversion.

C. Negligence and Habitability Failures

Florida Statute §83.51 and the implied warranty of habitability required you to keep the property safe and functional. From the start of the tenancy, you ignored urgent maintenance requests, such as the severely clogged kitchen sink, forcing me to resolve essential maintenance at my own expense. This established a pattern of negligence, influencing my subsequent actions to secure my property and personal safety.

Most egregious was your failure to address critical security issues after a documented break-in at the home. The intruder gained easy entry due to a dilapidated fence gate you never repaired despite knowing it posed a security risk. This put my safety and mental well-being at risk, aggravating my PTSD. Such disregard for tenant safety exposes you to claims for emotional distress, compensatory damages, and potentially punitive damages, since you knowingly left the property vulnerable.

D. Harassment, Coercive Communication, and Misrepresentation

After receiving my formal dispute letter, instead of providing the requested documentation or engaging in good-faith negotiations, you attempted to coerce me into phone calls. You left multiple voicemails and sent texts implying that “we are both supposed to” talk by phone, a blatant misrepresentation of legal requirements. Florida law imposes no obligation for verbal negotiation, and I had every right to keep communications in writing for clarity and record-keeping.

These intimidation tactics, coupled with your selective quoting of my messages to falsely portray my intentions regarding personal property retrieval, amount to harassment. Your attempts to avoid leaving a paper trail confirm that you intended to mislead and exploit your position as a lawyer. Courts do not look kindly on such behavior, and it bolsters my claims for aggravated damages.

E. Unregistered Business Entity and Fraud Concerns

You accepted rent payments through Amarlu Enterprises, a North Carolina entity never registered as a foreign LLC or authorized to do business in Florida. This unlawful operation raises concerns about the enforceability of the lease, the legitimacy of all rental-related transactions, and tax compliance. Under Florida Statute §605.0902, foreign entities must register before doing business. Your noncompliance suggests a willingness to skirt legal requirements at multiple levels, reinforcing the pattern of deception and reinforcing the argument that this was not an isolated misstep but a carefully orchestrated scheme.

III. Damages and Demand

Considering the severity of your statutory violations, I must now demand a significantly higher sum than previously contemplated. I gave you opportunities to comply and produce evidence, and you refused each time. Therefore, I demand:
1. Full Rent and Deposit Return:
Return the full $45,000 in rent and the entire $4,500 security deposit plus the $500 pet deposit, totaling $50,000. Your misconduct undermines the validity of the lease and forfeits your right to withhold any portion of the deposit.
2. Personal Property Compensation:
Pay the full $4,200 for my converted personal belongings.

This totals $54,200. Notably, this figure does not yet include treble damages, punitive damages, emotional distress damages, or attorney’s fees—all of which I could claim if we go to court. By paying $54,200 now, you can resolve the direct financial aspects of my claims without facing the even greater liabilities that a court proceeding would likely impose.

IV. Reporting to Professional and Regulatory Authorities

Even if you pay the demanded amount, I will proceed with reporting your conduct to the appropriate bar associations and state agencies. Your behavior raises serious ethical concerns. As an attorney, you knowingly disregarded statutory obligations, made misrepresentations, and attempted to pressure a tenant into undocumented negotiations. This reporting is not a bargaining chip. It is an independent duty I owe to ensure that your misconduct does not continue unchecked.

I will also report your unregistered foreign entity operations to the Florida Department of Revenue and the North Carolina Department of Revenue. Any settlement reached here does not and cannot preclude such reports, as they serve public and regulatory interests.

V. Timeline and Consequences of Non-Compliance

You have fifteen (15) days from receipt of this letter to remit the full $54,200. If you fail to comply, I will file suit in Florida Circuit Court. In litigation, I will seek not only the sums demanded here but also treble or punitive damages, emotional distress damages, attorney’s fees, and all other remedies authorized by Florida law. Given the extensive documentation of your bad faith, a court is likely to award far more than I am currently demanding.

VI. Conclusion

This letter is your final warning. You can choose to settle by paying $54,200, or you can risk a lawsuit that will publicly expose your professional misconduct and likely result in a substantially higher judgment against you. Nothing will dissuade me from reporting your actions to professional and regulatory bodies, as your misconduct demands oversight beyond private settlement.

Respond in writing and remit payment within fifteen (15) days if you wish to avoid further escalation. If you do not, I will immediately initiate litigation and all related complaints.

You have left me no choice but to take these comprehensive measures. Please govern yourself accordingly.
