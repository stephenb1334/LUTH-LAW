April 2024: Neglected Tree Maintenance and Immediate Safety Risks
Incident:
In April 2024, I notified you of sagging tree limbs hanging dangerously low over active electrical cables in the primary outdoor common area of the property. These limbs posed a clear and immediate safety risk, particularly given Florida’s severe weather conditions. Among the overgrown and hazardous vegetation were bamboo, a large alleged jackfruit tree, and other unidentified trees. These overhanging branches not only created a potential fire hazard due to contact with electrical lines but also posed a physical danger to anyone using the outdoor space below.

Despite the obvious safety concerns and my documented communications, you failed to take any corrective action to address or mitigate these hazards. Your inaction left tenants exposed to significant risks, including:

Electrical Fire: Overhanging limbs on electrical cables could ignite or sever the cables.
Personal Injury: Falling branches posed a clear danger to tenants and guests in the commonly used outdoor area.
Statutory Basis:

Fla. Stat. § 83.51(1)(a):
"The landlord at all times during the tenancy shall comply with the requirements of applicable building, housing, and health codes."
Fla. Stat. § 83.51(1)(b):
"The landlord shall maintain the roofs, windows, doors, floors, steps, porches, exterior walls, foundations, and all other structural components in good repair and capable of resisting normal forces and loads."
Violation:
By neglecting the overgrown trees and their interference with electrical lines, you failed to comply with the statutory requirement to maintain the property in good repair and to address safety hazards. Allowing hazardous vegetation to persist over electrical infrastructure violates applicable safety and housing codes and exposes you to liability for foreseeable harm caused by your failure to act.

Impact on Tenant:

Compromised Safety: The risk of electrical fires or falling limbs made the outdoor common area unsafe for use, depriving me of reasonable enjoyment of the property.
Emotional Distress: Given the violent home invasion in March and the landlord's repeated failure to address safety issues, your ongoing neglect exacerbated my anxiety and sense of insecurity.
Unreasonable Burden: I was left to navigate the risks associated with these hazards daily without any support or timeline for resolution.
Supporting Evidence:

Photographic and video documentation of sagging limbs over electrical cables.
Text communications outlining my notification of this issue and your failure to respond or act.
Witness testimony, if required, to corroborate the condition of the property and the associated hazards.


CONCLUSION:

This incident further demonstrates a consistent pattern of willful neglect and failure to meet statutory obligations under Fla. Stat. § 83.51. Your refusal to address critical safety hazards, including deteriorating gates, faulty motion lights, and overgrown hazardous vegetation, directly violates your duty to provide a habitable and safe property. These cumulative failures have subjected me to an unsafe living environment and emotional distress that are both avoidable and actionable under Florida law.
