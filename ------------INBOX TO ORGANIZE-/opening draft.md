RE: 


Property Address: 2649 TIFTON ST. S. GULFPORT, FL 33711

**Introduction** 

**Luther,**

  

Your November 8, 2024, letter and your settlement offer of $2,000—split between an arbitrary partial refund of my security deposit and a laughable amount for the personal property you withheld—are both legally insufficient and profoundly insulting. It is unfortunate that I even have to write this letter, but it appears necessary to remind you of the law or perhaps to reeducate you about these laws, which is both remarkable and disheartening considering your profession as a licensed attorney. 

If this letter, and its clear understanding and depiction of the law as it is written for us both to lean on, serves as a reminder of how such laws exist, operate for landlords and tenants, and so forth, it highlights your **negligence**. If it serves as a lesson, it reveals your **ignorance**. 

If it is a reiteration of a law you thought you understood but applied incorrectly, it demonstrates **stupidity or forgetfulness** regarding your legal responsibilities. However, if this is a reiteration of laws you knew but chose to circumvent for personal gain, it unequivocally showcases your **arrogance and bad faith**.

I will now detail, with clarity and specificity, the legal failures, statutory breaches, and outright manipulations you employed during my tenancy at **2649 Tifton St. S., Gulfport, Florida**. I will rehash the prior claims you have chosen to dismiss and introduce the most damning liability you now face, stemming from your systematic disregard for business registration laws in Florida. This liability alone invalidates the lease agreement and exposes you and Mary O. Polk to significant penalties. In the vast education you've required me to obtain on Florida's tenant-landlord laws, with over 100 hours devoted to standing up against those who trample the rights of others, I will not just state, but demonstrate why there is unequivocal, undeniable evidence to render you defenseless at best, and with new claims to introduce, shifting towards fraudulent and certainly incriminating at worst.

  
To touch on that last statement, you, Luther Rollins, Jr. a stated lawyer, and your business partner, designed and provided a lease agreement identifying yourself and Mary O. Polk as landlords, excluding any mention of **Amarlu Enterprises**, a North Carolina-registered business entity you own. To the average reader, the severity of this is non-obvious as stated so simply, but by this point, you are aware of what I'm now aware of. 

With this craftful omission, admittedly non-obvious or wrong for any reason when observed by me, your tenant, you additionally padded your strategy by providing pre-stamped, pre-addressed envelopes instructing us to remit all rent payments—totaling **$45,000**—to Amarlu Enterprises. The lease was fully executed by four individuals, two leases and two individual landlords, not a company, certainly not a company called Amarlu Enterprises, and certainly not a company that has filed for business in the state of North Carolina, and certainly not a company that never filed its foreign entity and was approved to conduct business, and collect revenue, in the state of Florida, unbeknownst to the state of Florida as of this writing per the registrar logs found on the division of corporations in the state of Florida. Enterprises. 

The lease was fully executed by four individuals, two leases and two individual landlords, not a company, certainly not a company called Amarlu Enterprises, and certainly not a company that has filed for business in the state of North Carolina, and certainly not a company that never filed its foreign entity and was approved to conduct business, and collect revenue, in the state of Florida, unbeknownst to the state of Florida as of this writing per the registrar logs found on the division of corporations in the state of Florida.  

Every single check, each $4,500, for a lease totalling $45,000 (+$500 Pet Fee) plus the addition of the **$4,500 refundable security deposit**, was directed to an entity that is not registered to conduct business in Florida, as required under **Florida Statutes § 605.0902**. The failure to register Amarlu Enterprises as a foreign entity in Florida is not a technical oversight; it is a deliberate evasion of regulatory, tax, and legal obligations that exposes you to liability at multiple levels.

And it has consequences that are non-refutable by law, entitling tenants to a full refund of the lease amount, removing your right to retain the security deposit (and pet fee), plus penalizing multipliers under punitive, treble, and statutory-related violations. Further, I can provide even more ample proof that this was all in bad faith, declaring the largest punitive multiplier in contention to remittance, with a high plausibility of conviction in addition to possible criminal convictions that I look forward to passing along to the governing bodies of your legal profession first in the state of Missouri, where you hold your license, and in the state of North Carolina, where you are approved to practice. 


Your purposeful decision to commit fraud is an accident or oversight to a common landlord, perhaps. That level of negligence exists, but you are sworn to an oath to know, represent, and uphold the law. This is a violation of my rights that you attempted this, but worse, it is now my responsibility to step in and do my best to prevent you from carrying onward.  

You chose, not mistakenly, to make decisions I have uncovered. You chose to operate unlawfully through an unregistered business entity, which does more than violate Florida law—it renders the lease null and unenforceable. By concealing the role of Amarlu Enterprises while systematically funneling payments through it, you denied me transparency, undermined your credibility, and created significant financial and legal exposure for yourself and your business partner. The evidence I have—including the lease agreement, payment records, and your own instructions—is incontrovertible. This was not an accident; it was a calculated act of deception designed to obscure the true nature of your operations in Florida.


Beyond this fatal issue, I will address your repeated mischaracterizations of my claims as exaggerated or unfounded. You assert that you have photos, witnesses, and other documentation to support your position, yet you fail to produce even a shred of admissible evidence to substantiate your deductions from my security deposit or your handling of my personal property. Meanwhile, I have provided a detailed, documented record of your failures:

• **The $4,500 security deposit** was not returned within the legally mandated timeline, nor was an itemized list of deductions ever provided, as required under **Fla. Stat. § 83.49(3)**.

• **My personal property, valued at $4,200 after depreciation**, was unlawfully withheld in violation of **Fla. Stat. §§ 715.10–715.111**, with no notice or opportunity for retrieval provided.

• **The lease itself** reflects glaring omissions and structural defects, all of which you, as a licensed attorney, should have been aware of and prevented.

  

Your conduct during and after the tenancy further compounds your violations. Your repeated attempts to coerce me into phone conversations, despite my explicit preference for written communication, are a transparent attempt to avoid accountability. Your manipulations of certified mail processes, including the use of incorrect ZIP codes and inconsistent address formatting, introduced unnecessary delays in correspondence. These behaviors are not just inconvenient; they are further evidence of bad faith and an ongoing pattern of evasion.

  

And now we arrive at the question of settlement. Your offer of **$2,000**, in light of the legal and financial exposure you face, is absurd. It disregards the penalties, treble damages, and restitution owed under Florida law for your mishandling of the security deposit, unlawful retention of personal property, fraudulent misrepresentation, and illegal business operations. It also fails to account for the professional standards you are obligated to uphold as an attorney licensed in North Carolina and Missouri. Rest assured, the bar associations in both states will be made aware of your systematic disregard for the law, regardless of your response to this letter.

  
Let me be clear: I reject your settlement offer in full. I have invested considerable time and effort in uncovering the extent of your violations, and I am prepared to pursue this matter to the fullest extent in Florida Circuit Court. 

My claims are supported by statutes, case law, and an exhaustive record of evidence that leaves no room for plausible deniability on your part. Suppose you wish to avoid the financial, professional, and reputational consequences of litigation. In that case, you must present a significantly improved offer that reflects the gravity of your misconduct and compensates me accordingly.

  

This letter will serve not only as a formal rejection of your offer but also as a prelude to action. I will take this matter to court, to the relevant regulatory authorities, and to the professional bodies governing your legal career. Whether this becomes a reminder of the law, a lesson in the law, or an irrevocable consequence of your decision to flout the law is entirely up to you. But make no mistake: your actions have consequences, and I am fully prepared to ensure you face them.

  
The following contents articulate my investment of time to uphold the law when the lawyers of our nation misrepresent their patriotic, democratic responsibility to serve the people, act accordingly among the people, and for the people. God Bless America, Luther.
