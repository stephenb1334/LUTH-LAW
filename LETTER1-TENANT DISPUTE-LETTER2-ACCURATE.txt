--------------
I. Opening Statement
Dear Mr. Rollins:
This letter serves as a formal response, and dispute, to your "Notice
of Intention to Impose Claim on Security Deposit" (hereinafter referred
to as "the Notice") dated October 1, 2024, mailed October 2, 2024, and
received by me, Stephen Boerner, the prior tenant, on October 5, 2024.
Pursuant to Florida Statute §83.49(3)(b), a written response is being
sent on Friday, October 18th, 2024, via USPS Certified Mail within the
legally 15-day timeframe allotted for a tenant's response and
constitutes a formal dispute to your claims on deposit.
Additionally, I am delivering herein my claims against you, the
landlord, for illegal handling of personal property.
This letter outlines in detail the legal and factual basis for my
dispute, addresses each of your claims individually, provides detail
supporting my claims against you, the landlord, and proposes options
for resolution.
II. Overview of Claim on Deposit:
Your Notice purports to justify withholding my entire security deposit
of $4,500 based on an inspection allegedly conducted "on or about
September 4, 2024." The Notice lists several claims of damage or issues
with the property as follows:
1. Excessive garbage and trash in the front and rear yards
2. Spoiling food in the refrigerator
3. Damage to the walls of the premises
4. Unauthorized hanging lights
5. Unauthorized removal of wood cabinets, shelving, counters, and
other alterations without landlord consent
6. Unauthorized whiteboard affixed to exterior wall of the premises
7. Missing and damaged artwork, furnishings, and housewares inventory
list items
8. Tenant personal property left in the house, garage, tiki hut, and
front and rear yards
9. Unauthorized cutting by tenant of the legacy jackfruit tree in the
rear yard (may cause the tree to become diseased, wither and/or
die)
10.Tenant stayed in the premises several days beyond the lease
expiration date
11.Caused the landlord to be unable to show or relet the premises
due to tenant extended occupancy and overall unclean condition
12.Extensive cleaning will be required to restore the premises to
the standard and condition that it was in when the tenants moved
in at the start of the lease
I will address individually in its dedicated section of this letter.
However, before delving into the specific claims, it is necessary to
address the overall deficiencies in your Notice and actions, which
render your claim on my security deposit legally invalid.
Given the seriousness of these issues and the clear violations of
Florida law, I request that you respond to this letter within 15 days
of receipt, indicating your preferred option for resolution as outlined
in Section VIII of this letter.
Failure to respond within this timeframe may result in legal action to
recover my security deposit and damages for unlawful retention of
personal property.
III. Detailed Rebuttal of Your Claims & Non-Compliance with Florida Statute
§83.49(3)
A. Failure to Provide Proper Notice
Your Notice fails to comply with Florida Statute §83.49(3)(a) in
several critical aspects:
Lack of Specificity and Itemization:
While Florida law does not require a fully itemized breakdown of
every cost, it does require enough specificity so the tenant can
make an informed response. Your Notice is overly vague, making it
impossible for me to adequately assess or respond. Based on my
general recollection of the property, I will address each claim,
though I am limited by the lack of detail provided in your
Notice.
1. Excessive Garbage and Trash in the Front and Rear Yards
Response:
Your claim of “excessive garbage and trash” lacks any
specific details regarding the amount, location, or
cost of removal, leaving me with little to rely on
other than my own recollection. Based on my memory,
any trash present at the time of my departure was
placed in the appropriate area for collection, and
any excess trash was the result of a garbage
collection delay that was beyond my control. I had
arranged for additional removal services that were
subsequently canceled due to a [storm, municipal
delay, etc.]. Without clear evidence or photos of the
trash, I cannot be sure what your claim refers to,
and therefore, I dispute this charge as speculative.
2. Spoiled Food in the Refrigerator
Response:
The allegation of “spoiled food” is similarly vague.
You have provided no photos, description of the
extent of the issue, or costs related to the cleanup.
From what I can recall, there were a few perishable
items left in the refrigerator, but nothing that
would have caused significant damage or required
anything beyond standard cleaning, which is typically
included in turnover between tenants. Again, without
supporting documentation, I can only rely on my
recollection, and I dispute the necessity of
withholding a portion of the security deposit for
what seems like a minor issue.
3. Damage to the Walls of the Premises
Response:
Your Notice references “damage to the walls,” but it
provides no details regarding which walls were
affected, the nature of the damage, or whether it was
interior or exterior. Based on my memory, I recall
minor scuff marks on some walls, which are typical
wear and tear for a one-year tenancy. Florida law is
clear that tenants are not liable for normal wear and
tear (see Fipps v. Robinson, 612 So.2d 689 (Fla. 1st
DCA 1993)). Without specifying where or what kind of
damage you’re referring to, I cannot address this
claim in any meaningful way. Your lack of detail
prevents me from fully responding, and as such, I
dispute this charge.
I deny causing any damage to the walls beyond normal
wear and tear. Without specific details or
photographic evidence, it is impossible to assess the
validity of this claim.
Furthermore, Florida law (e.g., Fipps v. Robinson,
612 So.2d 689 (Fla. 1st DCA 1993)) establishes that
tenants are not responsible for normal wear and tear.
4. Unauthorized Hanging Lights
Response:
I recall installing temporary hanging lights, which
were non-permanent and removed prior to vacating. The
claim of damage caused by these lights is unclear—was
there any specific damage documented? As you have not
provided photos or a description of what this damage
entailed, I am left to rely solely on my memory,
which tells me that no damage was left behind from
these lights. I can only conclude that any minor
marks would fall under normal wear and tear, which is
not chargeable to the tenant under Florida law.
Further, these lights are located on the personal
property Addendum outlining all personal property
that falls under the full list of illegal held, and
converted, personal property as your Notice mentions
personal property left behind pointing to the
landlord burden to respond accordingly with written
notice for removal that was not met by you, the
landlord.
5. Unauthorized Removal of Wood Cabinets, Shelving,
Counters, and Other Alterations Without Landlord Consent
Response:
You claim that I made unauthorized alterations, such
as the removal of cabinets or shelving.
Without specifics, I, nor a overriding court
authority, can not appraise this claim.
I require photographic evidence of the alterations—I
am unable to properly assess this claim. Based on my
recollection, there were poorly fixed, unusable
fixtures were altered, and therefore, I dispute a
portion of the claim as unsupported and speculative.
6. Unauthorized Whiteboard Affixed to Exterior Wall of the
Premises
Response:
While I do recall using a temporary whiteboard, it
was attached with non-permanent methods and was not
removed before vacating the property. This was not
trash nor abandoned property, nor was it "affixed" as
it was hanging on a shelf, built accordingly, to
avoid affixation to exteriror walls.
Your claim, stating "affixed" is incorrect and fails
to explain whether the issue is damage to the wall or
simply the use of the whiteboard declaring "affixed"
as the assumed reason for such a claim, which it was
not.
Since no documentation or photos of the wall have
been provided, I can only rely on my memory, which
tells me that no damage was caused by this, and
personal property left mishandled. I therefore
dispute this claim.
7. Missing and Damaged Artwork, Furnishings, and Housewares
Inventory List Items
Response:
Your Notice mentions “missing and damaged artwork,
furnishings, and housewares,” but it does not specify
which items were allegedly missing or damaged. At no
point was I provided with an inventory list during my
tenancy, and I cannot recall any specific items being
damaged or removed. Without an inventory list or
photos to reference, this claim is entirely
speculative, and I have no way to assess the accuracy
of the allegation. As such, I dispute this claim.
8. Tenant Personal Property Left in the House, Garage, Tiki
Hut, and Front and Rear Yards
Response:
While I made several documented attempts to retrieve
my personal property, many of which went ignored (see
Addendum C), I cannot recall leaving significant
items behind that would have necessitated disposal.
However, your Notice does not provide any details on
what personal property was left or the cost of
removal, making it impossible for me to confirm the
validity of this claim. Without documentation, I
dispute this charge.
9. Unauthorized Cutting by Tenant of the Legacy Jackfruit
Tree in the Rear Yard
Response:
I recall pruning the jackfruit tree for safety
reasons, as it was overgrown and posed a risk to the
yard. This action was in line with the maintenance
responsibilities I took on after prior maintenance
requests to the landlord were unmet and unresponded
to such as a kitchen sink in, or around October 2023,
that you failed to act on resulting on me, the
tenant, taking on the responsibility to make the
kitchen sink usable again. This is in addition to
your mention of installing a new fence gate to
prevent furthter intruders from easily entering the
backyard, and subsequently our home, which did occur
on March 26th, 2024. You responded by verbally
agreeing to a new fence, that the existing fence gate
was deteriated, and used verbiage of "metal fence
door with lock" that we relied on. No action was
taken after the attempted burgurly on the fence gate
which remained loose, accessible, and dangerous. For
these reasons, I tended to the safety issue of
hanging branches over heavily used areas in the
backyard, and branches encroaching on powerlines
leading the house.
I've included a copy of the police report from the
March 26th, 2024 incident I alluded to.
You claim that this could cause the tree to become
diseased, but you have provided no expert assessment
or evidence to support this claim. Pruning a tree for
safety reasons is reasonable under Florida law, and
without specific documentation or photos showing
damage, I dispute this claim.
10. Tenant Stayed in the Premises Several Days Beyond the
Lease Expiration Date
Response:
I vacated the premises on September 2nd, 2024. I
provided detail to your proxy that movers had
canceled the day of due to the large storm that
arrived. In addition, I provided details of our next
location of stay being cancelled the day of, also due
to storm, the same storm that delayed garbage
collection from the City of Gulfport, FL. Further, I
outlined mental health issues this caused and the
subsequent panic attack I endured.
Your claim that I stayed beyond the lease term is
accurage, but to point to any dollar amount
associated to this line item does not exist, and if
it did, is unsubstantiated.
I dispute this charge in full.
11. Caused the Landlord to Be Unable to Show or Relet the
Premises Due to Extended Occupancy and Unclean Condition
Response:
There is no documentation supporting your claim that
the property was “unclean” or that I caused a delay
in reletting, so I dispute this claim in full.
12. Extensive Cleaning Will Be Required to Restore the
Premises to the Condition It Was In at Move-In
Response:
Your statement that “extensive cleaning will be
required” is speculative and vague. Based on my
recollection, the property was left in clean
condition, and any minor cleaning required is part of
the normal turnover process between tenants. Given
that the property was relisted almost immediately,
any extensive cleaning claims seem unwarranted. I
dispute this claim as speculative and unsupported by
any documentation, such as cleaning invoices or
before-and-after photos.
I am willing to take responsibility for minor, admitted
issues, only on the basis that photographic evidence
showing before and after evidence, is provided
However, the vast majority of your claims are too vague,
unsupported by evidence, or speculative in nature. Without
the necessary specifics or documentation, I cannot
adequately evaluate or agree with your claims, and
therefore, I formally dispute the majority of the
deductions.Furhter, they point to an inventory list that
was never provide, formerly or informerly, nor was it
included in the mutally signed lease agreement.
If necessary, I am prepared to pursue this matter further,
as Florida law requires landlords to provide specific and
supported claims when withholding a tenant’s security
deposit.
Unauthorized Use and Conversion of Personal Property
As of mid-October 2024, I am aware that my personal belongings,
specifically including my Weber Spirit E-310 Propane Grill and other
items, remain on the property. Despite multiple documented requests to
retrieve these items, which were ignored (see Addendum C), the property
is now being marketed with amenities that include “barbequing” in the
backyard.
I have attached screenshots (see Addendum D) of the current rental
listing, which explicitly mentions “barbequing” as an amenity. Notably,
this was not advertised in the rental listing when I originally leased
the property last year, indicating that my personal grill is being used
to promote the property to new tenants.
This constitutes unauthorized use and conversion of my personal
property under Florida law. Conversion occurs when someone unlawfully
exercises control over another person’s property in a manner
inconsistent with the owner’s rights. Your failure to allow me to
retrieve my property and the ongoing marketing of that property without
my consent makes you liable for conversion.
IV. Invalidity of Claims Due to Lack of Inventory List
Your Notice references "missing and damaged artwork, furnishings,
and housewares inventory list items." However, this claim is
invalid and unenforceable for the following reasons:
No Specific Inventory List Provided:
Upon careful review of the lease agreement, I found no specific
inventory list of the landlord's personal property (such as
furnishings, artwork, or housewares) provided within the
document. While the lease does refer to "all furnishings and
personal property" as being included with the property, it does
not itemize what those furnishings or personal property items
are.
Absence of Separate Inventory Documentation:
At no point during my tenancy was I provided with a separate
inventory list detailing the specific items of furniture,
artwork, or housewares that were considered part of the rental
property.
Lack of Baseline for Comparison:
Without an initial, itemized inventory, it is impossible to
substantiate claims of missing or damaged items. There is no
baseline against which to compare the condition of the property
at the end of the tenancy.
Unreasonable Accountability:
Holding tenants accountable for items that were never clearly
defined or documented at the start of my tenancy is unreasonable
and potentially unlawful.
Burden of Proof:
The burden of proving the existence, condition, and value of any
item claimed to be damaged or missing lies with you, the
landlord. Without a detailed inventory list, you cannot meet this
burden of proof.
Legal Precedent:In Johnson v. Baker, 388 So.2d 1056 (Fla. 4th DCA
1980), the court held that without an inventory or evidence of
the property's condition at the beginning of the tenancy, a
landlord cannot prove that a tenant caused damages. This
principle extends to claims of missing items as well.
Furthermore, in Durene v. Alcime, 448 So.2d 1208 (Fla. 3d DCA
1984), the court emphasized the importance of proper
documentation in landlord-tenant disputes. The absence of a
detailed inventory list significantly weakens any claim related
to personal property items.
C. Request for Disclosure of Security Deposit Details:
Pursuant to Florida Statute §83.49(2), and as included in the
signed lease agreement on page 10 of 20, which requires landlords
who own or manage five or more rental units to disclose the
location and status of the security deposit within 30 days of
receiving it, which was not provided to me, the tenant, I hereby
request that you confirm:
- The number of rental units you own or manage in the state
of Florida.
- Whether my security deposit was placed in a separate bank
account, and if so, whether the account is interest-bearing
or non-interest-bearing.
This information is crucial to ensuring full compliance with
Florida law and transparency in our landlord-tenant relationship.
D. Pattern of Landlord Negligence and Tenant's Reasonable Actions
It is crucial to note that your failure to address maintenance issues
began early in the tenancy and established a pattern of negligence that
influenced my subsequent actions regarding property maintenance. As
detailed in Addendum A, which provides a comprehensive timeline of
maintenance requests and actions taken during the tenancy:
Initial Maintenance Request Ignored:
On or about October 2023, at the early onset of the lease, I
encountered a severely clogged kitchen sink drain, rendering the
left portion of the two-bucket sink unusable. I promptly
submitted a maintenance request regarding this issue.
Tenant's Reasonable Response:
Given the urgency of the problem and your lack of response, I was
forced to address the issue myself. Using my basic knowledge of
clogged plumbing systems and a $15 liquid solution, I
successfully unclogged the drain and restored functionality to
the sink.
Established Pattern of Landlord Negligence & Justification for
Tenant's Actions:
This early instance of neglect set a precedent for how I had to
handle future maintenance issues. Your demonstrated unwillingness
to comply with your legal obligations to maintain the premises
under Florida Statute §83.51 led me to take on necessary
maintenance tasks to ensure the habitability of the property.
Extreme Reasoning for Tenant's Resonable Response:
In addition, the previously mentioned break-in on March 26th,
2024 provided extermemly valid concern for tenant safety. You
mentioned action you would take, but did not. Further, as seen in
the text message documentation, I proposed acting independent of
you, propsing the installation of Ring Security cameras.
Your response, as shown, was to allow it, but on the condition of
"no screwing." This was a rediculous response to one of my two
inquiring. The second inquiry was around our safety and the need
for better fence gates. That went ignored in your response. You
only addressed the request for security cameras, similar cameras
that seemingly every neighbor on Tifton ST. South has - for good
reason.
This pattern of negligence, unresponsiveness, over committing to
actions that were never performed provide solid ground as to why
taking our own safety measure, including maintenance only
related to potential power outages due to unattended, sagging
branches was an action performed with just cause, by the tenant,
Stephen Boerner, as outlined herein. I understood that our
safety and maintenance needs were a low priority based on actions
observed which lowered any reasonable expectations for future
support.
Timeline of Events:
Please refer to Addendum C for a detailed timeline (documented in
text messages between Luther Rollins and Stephen Boerner, of
maintenance requests, follow-ups, and actions taken throughout
the tenancy. Due to Apple overwriting text messages prior to the
start of 2024, the sink incident is not documented, but a
subpoena would support this claim.
This timeline is supported by email correspondence, text
messages, and receipts, all of which are included in Addendum C.
This pattern of negligence not only violates Florida Statute
§83.51 but also demonstrates a breach of the implied warranty of
habitability. It provides context for my actions throughout the
tenancy and should be considered when evaluating any claims
against the security deposit.
V. Violation of Florida Statute §715.104 Regarding Personal Property
A. Unlawful Retention and Disposal of Personal Property
Your actions regarding my personal property left on the premises are in
direct violation of Florida Statute §715.104(1), which states:
"After taking possession of the premises... the landlord shall give
written notice to the former tenant... stating that the property is
considered abandoned and that the landlord intends to dispose of it if
not claimed."
You have failed to comply with this statute in the following ways:
You did not provide the required written notice regarding abandoned
property.
You failed to respond to my multiple written requests, dated September
25, 2024, and September 27, 2024, for access to retrieve my personal
property.
Your failure to provide the required notice and your lack of response
to my documented attempts to retrieve my property constitute a clear
violation of the statute.
B. Unauthorized Use and Conversion of Personal Property
Your new rental listing advertises amenities that include my personal
property, specifically my Weber Spirit E-310 Propane Grill. This
constitutes unauthorized use and conversion of my property.
Legal Precedent:
In Goodwin v. Alexatos, 584 So.2d 1007 (Fla. 5th DCA 1991), the court
held that unauthorized retention and use of another's property
constitutes conversion, entitling the owner to recover the property's
value and potentially punitive damages.
C. Liability for Damages
Under Florida Statute §715.109:
"A landlord who does not comply with this part shall be liable to the
former tenant for actual damages or three months' rent, whichever is
greater, and costs of the action."
Given that my monthly rent was $4,500.00, you could be liable for
$13,500.00 plus costs the action and costs if this matter proceeds to
litigation.
VI. Proposed Options for Resolution
In an effort to resolve this matter amicably, I propose the following
options:
VIII. Proposed Options for Resolution
In an effort to resolve this matter amicably, I propose the following
options:
Option 1: Immediate Settlement
•
Payment to Me:
•
Full Value of Personal Property: $4,210.62
•
Half of Security Deposit: $2,250.00
•
Total Payment: $6,460.62
•
No Further Action: Upon receipt of this payment, I will
consider the matter fully resolved and will not pursue additional legal
action regarding this issue.
This option allows for a swift and mutually beneficial resolution with
minimal effort on your part.
Option 2: Full Compliance and Reconciliation
•
Burden of Proof: You provide a comprehensive, itemized list
substantiating all your claims and allegations, including:
•
Detailed Itemization: Specific damages and associated
costs.
•
Supporting Documentation: Receipts, invoices, photographs,
and any relevant evidence.
•
Inventory List: A complete inventory of items allegedly
missing or damaged.
•
Adjust Claims Accordingly: We reconcile any discrepancies
based on the provided evidence. You return any unsubstantiated portion
of the security deposit and address the issue of my personal property.
•
Legal Compliance: Ensure full adherence to Florida statutes
in all communications and actions to avoid litigation.
This option requires significant effort on your part to meet the full
burden of proof as mandated by law.
Option 3: Legal Action
No Response or Inadequate Resolution: If you do not respond
appropriately within the 15-day period, I will proceed with legal
action.
•
•
Claims Sought in Litigation:
•
Full Security Deposit: $4,500.00
•
Value of Personal Property: $4,210.62
•
Total Amount Sought: $8,710.62
•
Additional Remedies:
•
Statutory Damages: Potentially exceeding $13,500.00 under
Florida Statutes §§83.49 and 715.104.
•
Attorney’s Fees and Court Costs
•
Punitive Damages: For willful and malicious conduct.
I am prepared to file a claim at the county level, outside of small
claims court, to pursue the full extent of damages allowable under the
law.
This option provides a structured environment for resolving our
differences without resorting to litigation.
VII. Conclusion and Next Steps
Given the seriousness of the violations outlined in this letter and the
potential legal consequences, I strongly urge you to carefully consider
the proposed options for resolution. Your failure to comply with
Florida law regarding security deposits and personal property puts you
at risk of significant financial penalties and legal action.
I request that you respond to this letter within 15 days of receipt,
indicating your preferred option for resolution. If I do not receive a
satisfactory response within this timeframe, I will have no choice but
to pursue legal remedies, including but not limited to:
1. Filing a complaint with the Florida Department of Business and
Professional Regulation.
2. Initiating a small claims court action for the return of my security
deposit and the value of my personal property.
3. Seeking treble damages as allowed under Florida Statute §83.49(3)
(c).
4. Pursuing additional damages for conversion of personal property.
I sincerely hope we can resolve this matter amicably and avoid the need
for legal action. However, I am prepared to vigorously defend my rights
as a tenant under Florida law if necessary.
Please direct all future communication regarding this matter to me in
writing at the address provided at the beginning of this letter.
Sincerely,
Stephen Boerner
