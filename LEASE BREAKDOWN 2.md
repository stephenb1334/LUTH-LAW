83.50 - Disclosure of Landlord's Address - The LEASE states that the Landlord must list a "landlord address" and certain written permissions are required to be sent to the landlord in writing. The landlord did not list his address in Hickory, NC. Rather, the landlord listed the same address as the leased property in which the lease was being executed for. It could be stated that written permission for any claim such as altering the property was not possible due to the written permissions being executed per the lease and thus the written requests for permission would just end up in the same mailbox that attempted to mail requests to the landlord. this is another example of bad, improper, unethical, sneaky attention to detail.
The landlord address listed is the same address as the leased home address.  More bad faith?
