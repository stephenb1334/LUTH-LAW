### **Expert Witness Report: Mail System Address Analysis**

**Prepared by: [Your Name / Title]**  
**Subject: Address Discrepancy Between Suite Number and PO Box Number**

***

#### **Overview of Findings**

The purpose of this report is to analyze and provide expert insight regarding the unusual occurrence of matching numeric designations between a **physical suite number** and a **Post Office Box (PO Box)**. Specifically, the following address details have been provided:

1.  **Physical Address**:  
    231 Government Ave SW
    #3097  
    Hickory, NC 28603
    
2.  **Mailing Address**:  
    231 Government Ave SW
    PO Box #3097  
    Hickory, NC 28603
    

The inquiry seeks to determine the likelihood, plausibility, and reasoning behind the numeric match (**3097**) for both the suite number and the PO Box number.

#### **Address System and Mail Delivery Context**

1.  **Physical Address (Unit/Suite Numbers)**:
    
    -   Unit or suite numbers are assigned within a **physical property** or building.
    -   These numbers are managed by the **property owner, landlord, or property management company** to distinguish individual units in a building.
    -   Example: **231 Government Ave SW Unit #3097** refers to a specific suite within a physical property.
2.  **PO Box Numbers**:
    
    -   PO Boxes are secure mail receptacles located at a **Post Office**.
    -   The **United States Postal Service (USPS)** assigns PO Box numbers sequentially or upon request, subject to availability.
    -   Example: **PO Box #3097** is located at a local post office in Hickory, NC.

#### **Unusual Numeric Match: Unit #3097 and PO Box #3097**

The numeric match between **Unit #3097** (a physical suite) and **PO Box #3097** (a postal address) is highly unusual. Such a match is atypical in standard address systems for the following reasons:

1.  **Independent Assignment Systems**:
    
    -   Suite/unit numbers are managed by private property owners, whereas PO Box numbers are assigned by USPS.
    -   These systems typically operate independently, making a numeric match improbable.
2.  **Statistical Probability**:
    
    -   Given the range of potential PO Box numbers and suite numbers, a numeric match occurring randomly is **statistically low**.
    -   PO Boxes are typically assigned sequentially based on availability, while unit numbers often reflect internal building organization.

***

#### **Possible Explanations for the Match**

1.  **Intentional Assignment for Convenience**:
    
    -   In some cases, property owners or businesses intentionally align a **PO Box number** with their physical suite number for consistency.
    -   This may be requested for branding purposes or to simplify mail handling.
2.  **Small Community or Limited Assignment Pool**:
    
    -   In smaller towns, such as Hickory, NC, fewer units and PO Boxes are available.
    -   This increases the likelihood of overlapping or matching numbers due to limited options.
3.  **Special Request to USPS**:
    
    -   Individuals or businesses can request specific PO Box numbers, subject to availability.
    -   A business or resident occupying **Unit #3097** may have requested **PO Box #3097** for uniformity.
4.  **Coincidence**:
    
    -   While rare, the numeric overlap could occur coincidentally when both systems assign numbers independently.

***

#### **Conclusion of Findings**

Based on the provided data and the expert analysis of address systems:

-   The occurrence of **matching numbers** between **Unit #3097** and **PO Box #3097** is atypical but plausible.
-   The most likely explanations are **intentional assignment** for convenience, a special request to USPS, or a limited assignment pool in a smaller community like Hickory, NC.
-   While coincidental matches can occur, the low statistical probability suggests a deliberate or practical alignment.

The findings highlight no inherent mail system irregularities but underscore the unique circumstances surrounding this address scenario. Further inquiry into the USPS records or property management details may confirm whether the match was intentional or coincidental.
