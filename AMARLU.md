# Summary of Facts: Amarlu Enterprises, Amarlu Company, & Amarlu Consultants


The dispute between me, whom represents the rights to two individual tenants on the lease in question, and the landlords, Luther J Rollings & Mary. O. Polk, highlights serious legal, ethical, and procedural violations related to the landlords' failure to comply with Florida statutes and established landlord-tenant obligations. The landlords, Luther Rollins and Mary O. Polk, have knowingly orchestrated a rental arrangement that involves undisclosed entities, misrepresentation, and potential tax evasion, all of which jeopardize the enforceability of the lease agreement and undermine tenant protections under Florida law.

Amarlu Enterprises, a North Carolina entity, receives all rental payments despite being completely omitted from the lease. This concealment not only obscures the true contractual obligations but also violates statutory requirements for foreign entity registration and disclosure under Florida law. The landlords' actions have raised critical questions about transparency, compliance, and good faith in their dealings with tenants. 

The involvement of Mr. Zachary “Zach” Steinberger, acting in dual roles as a realtor with vested interests in future business dealings with the landlords, further complicates the matter, casting doubt on the impartiality and credibility of his evaluations.

This summary of facts underscores the legal implications of the landlords’ conduct, ranging from potential fraud and tax evasion to statutory violations. It establishes the foundation for the tenant's legal recourse and regulatory scrutiny to ensure accountability and adherence to Florida’s landlord-tenant laws.

**Landlord and Entity Identification:**

The lease agreement explicitly names only Luther Rollins and Mary O. Polk as landlords, acting in their individual capacities. Despite this, rent payments were directed to Amarlu Enterprises, a North Carolina-registered entity jointly owned by Rollins and Polk. However, the signed lease entirely omits this entity, concealing its critical role in collecting rental income.

**Payment Instructions and Practice:**

-   Upon move-in, tenants received pre-stamped, pre-addressed envelopes instructing them to pay rent to Amarlu Enterprises at 231 Government Ave #3094, Hickory, NC 28602.
-   Over the 10-month lease term, the tenants paid a total of $45,000 in rent to Amarlu Enterprises—an entity never disclosed in the lease or mentioned as a legally recognized party in Florida.

**Corporate Registration and Legal Compliance in Florida:**

-   Amarlu Enterprises is registered in North Carolina but does not appear in the Florida Division of Corporations’ database.
-   Under Florida Statutes § 605.0902, any out-of-state business entity engaging in business activities, including collecting rental income from Florida property, must register as a foreign entity.
-   Amarlu Enterprises’ failure to register in Florida constitutes a direct violation of Florida’s foreign entity registration requirements, compromising its legal standing and the landlords’ compliance with state business laws.

**Misrepresentation, Lack of Disclosure, and Tax Concerns:**

-   Instructing tenants to pay a non-disclosed, unregistered entity (Amarlu Enterprises) undermines tenants’ understanding of their contractual obligations and potentially violates Florida’s landlord-tenant transparency laws.
Diverting rental income through an unregistered foreign entity raises concerns about possible tax avoidance or evasion. If landlords intend to obscure the flow of income to circumvent Florida tax obligations, they may face severe legal consequences, including penalties, fines, and potential criminal charges.

**Fraud and Deception:**

The deliberate omission of Amarlu Enterprises from the lease agreement and the subsequent instruction to pay that entity could be construed as fraudulent. This setup potentially deceives tenants about the true nature of their rental arrangement and circumvents their legal and tax obligations in Florida.

**Involvement of Mr. Steinberger (Realtor):**

-   Mr. Zachary “Zach” Steinberger of Compass Realty in St. Petersburg, Florida, has ties to these transactions, including discussions regarding future real estate dealings with Luther.
-   Due to his vested interest in securing listings and ongoing work with Luther, Mr. Steinberger’s involvement presents a clear conflict of interest.
-   As a realtor, Mr. Steinberger is not a legally recognized authority on evaluating damages or providing a professional legal opinion. His input on the matter of damages or legal compliance is therefore null and void, lacking the requisite impartiality and professional credentials to influence legal or financial assessments in this dispute.

## OBSERVED VIOLATIONS

1.  **Foreign Entity Registration Violation:**  
    Amarlu Enterprises, as an out-of-state business collecting rental income in Florida, failed to register as a foreign LLC, breaching Florida Statutes § 605.0902.
    
2.  **Transparency and Disclosure Failures:**  
    Directing rent to an undisclosed entity violates the fundamental principle of informed consent in landlord-tenant relationships. Tenants were never made aware that their payments would go to Amarlu Enterprises, undermining trust and legal clarity.
    
3.  **Tax and Regulatory Risks:**  
    Using an unregistered entity to collect rent in Florida raises questions about accurate tax reporting and compliance with Florida state tax obligations.
    
4.  **Potential Fraud:**  
    Concealing Amarlu Enterprises’ role suggests intentional deception. Such fraudulent conduct can lead to civil and potentially criminal liability, including claims for damages, restitution, and attorney’s fees.
    
5.  **Conflict of Interest and Expert Validity:**  
    Mr. Steinberger’s opinions regarding damages or legal compliance lack professional standing due to his role as a realtor seeking business with Luther. His involvement cannot serve as a credible neutral evaluation of damages or liabilities.
    

***

The landlords’ orchestrated arrangement—omitting Amarlu Enterprises from the lease, instructing tenants to pay the unregistered entity, and potentially manipulating tax responsibilities—indicates a willful departure from lawful and transparent business practices. Such conduct undercuts the integrity of the landlord-tenant relationship, potentially harms tenants financially, and places the landlords at risk of significant legal penalties.

While Luther’s status as a legitimate attorney may shield him from allegations of misrepresenting his professional credentials, it does not absolve the legal obligations of registering Amarlu Enterprises as a foreign entity in Florida or disclosing it in the lease. The conflict of interest arising from Mr. Steinberger’s involvement and his lack of professional standing to assess damages only further highlights the need for impartial legal scrutiny and regulatory intervention.

The actions of landlords, particularly in directing rent through an undisclosed and unregistered entity, violate Florida’s statutory requirements and raise serious concerns regarding fraud, tax evasion, and overall legal compliance. These matters merit thorough regulatory review and, if unresolved, potential civil litigation to ensure accountability, restitution, and adherence to Florida’s laws governing foreign entities and landlord-tenant relationships.


### **Landlord’s Legal Violations**

1.  **Failure to Register a Foreign Entity (Florida Statutes § 605.0902):**
    
    -   The landlord's use of **Amarlu Enterprises**, a North Carolina entity, without registering it as a foreign entity in Florida constitutes an illegal business practice.
    -   The lease agreement's enforceability is undermined because the landlord conducted business unlawfully. Courts often hold that parties conducting illegal business cannot enforce contractual agreements based on that activity.
2.  **Non-Disclosure of Amarlu Enterprises:**
    
    -   The lease agreement identifies the landlords as individuals (Luther Rollins and Mary O. Polk) but does not disclose **Amarlu Enterprises** as a party involved in rent collection.
    -   Courts may interpret this omission as **fraudulent misrepresentation** or **bad faith**, rendering the lease terms invalid or unenforceable.
3.  **Consequences of Non-Compliance:**
    
    -   Florida law typically prevents unregistered entities from bringing claims in Florida courts until compliance is achieved. Thus, even if the landlord proves the tenant caused damages, the landlord may lack the legal standing to pursue those claims.

## Tenant’s Argument: Unenforceability of the Lease:


**The tenant claims that the lease is void or unenforceable due to the landlord's illegal conduct.**

Payments to an undisclosed and unregistered entity violate Florida law and demonstrate bad faith, overshadowing any claim for property damages.

**Good Faith Argument:**

The tenant asserts they acted in good faith by adhering to the lease terms as written, including fulfilling rent obligations. Any proven damages are minor and do not excuse the landlord’s broader statutory violations.

**Offset of Damages:**

Even if the court finds the tenant liable for damages, the tenant requests an offset against statutory damages, treble damages for deposit mishandling, and restitution of improperly collected rent.

Furthermore, as to the landlord’s recent written claim for the entire $4,500.00 security deposit, I must reiterate the dire legal implications arising from your unlawful conduct. While you have notified me, via certified mail within the statutory deadline, of your intent to impose a claim against the full security deposit, the alleged damages you describe—ranging from excessive trash and spoiled food to unauthorized alterations, missing items, and purported impact on a legacy jackfruit tree—must be evaluated against the backdrop of your underlying statutory violations and the enforceability of the lease itself.

Florida law (Fla. Stat. § 83.49) sets forth clear standards for security deposit claims, requiring landlords to provide concrete, itemized evidence of any damages beyond normal wear and tear. General assertions, unsupported by photographs, inventories, or receipts establishing pre- and post-tenancy conditions, typically fail to satisfy these standards. Without verifiable documentation—such as a signed move-in checklist, itemized valuations of each allegedly missing or damaged furnishing, and verifiable repair estimates—a court would be disinclined to uphold a claim for the full $4,500 deposit. Normal expectations of tenancy, including some level of cleaning upon move-out, do not justify the wholesale forfeiture of the deposit. Minor incidents, like temporarily spoiled food, are not substantial grounds for withholding the entire sum, and any claim of unauthorized alterations or missing items must be accompanied by explicit proof and pre-approved conditions stated in the lease.

More importantly, the entire contractual framework upon which your claim depends is compromised by your deliberate use of an undisclosed and unregistered foreign entity—Amarlu Enterprises—to receive all rental payments, including the security deposit. Under Fla. Stat. § 605.0902, any out-of-state entity conducting business in Florida must register as a foreign entity. Your conscious choice to funnel $45,000 in rent plus the $4,500 security deposit through an entity never disclosed in the lease and never registered in Florida renders the contract you seek to enforce legally questionable, if not outright void. As a result, a court would likely find that you lack standing to enforce provisions of a lease founded upon unlawful business operations. In other words, even if you could demonstrate legitimate damages (which you have not), the legal taint of your noncompliance with Florida’s foreign entity registration requirements would likely invalidate your claim on the security deposit.

This critical legal defect is compounded by the absence of transparent disclosure of Amarlu Enterprises in the lease, as well as your ongoing attempts to circumvent the statutory and good-faith obligations that Florida imposes on landlords. Given these facts, a Florida court, upon thorough examination, would almost certainly lean toward invalidating your entire claim and requiring the full return of the security deposit to me. The court may also, in light of such bad faith and statutory noncompliance, consider treble damages or other remedies designed to penalize landlords who fail to adhere to Florida’s clear statutory mandates.

In sum, while you have formally claimed $4,500 in supposed damages, the legal reality is that your own violations overshadow any unproven, undocumented assertions about cleaning or property damage. Without proper registration of your foreign entity, without clear, itemized evidence of actual damages, and without a lease free from deception and misrepresentation, you stand on legally indefensible ground. Under these circumstances, I have every reason to believe the court would not only reject your claim for the full $4,500 security deposit but would also potentially award me statutory damages for your bad-faith retention and serious legal violations.
